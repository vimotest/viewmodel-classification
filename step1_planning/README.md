# Step 1: Planning the MLR

In the first step, we plan the MLR.

## Motivation

Our motivation derives from a missing overview of MVVM design variants and trade-offs.

The MVVM standard definition (see `step2_search_process/mvvm_standard_definition.md`) leaves a lot of room open for the real implementation.
Therefore, developers can easily overlook design variants, or do not know all possible trade-offs.

## Goals

We aim for the goal to identify MVVM design variants and extended benefits/drawback.
The main goal is to find extensions to the standard MVVM definition, which we use as a baseline.

## Research Questions

```
RQ1: Which design variants are people using when implementing MVVM?
```

```
RQ2: Which trade-offs do people mention when applying MVVM?
```

## Outcome

The two research questions to guide our MLR.
