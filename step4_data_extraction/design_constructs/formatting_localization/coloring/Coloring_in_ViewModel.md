# Coloring in ViewModel

## Summary
ViewModel has the logic to control colors which the view shall use when rendering.

## Details
The ViewModel provides fields if colors in the view are needed. This way, the ViewModel has the logic to determine the color, and the view is free of this responsibility - it simply uses a given color.
