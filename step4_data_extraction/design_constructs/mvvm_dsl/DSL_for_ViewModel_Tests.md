# DSL for ViewModel Tests

## Summary
A DSL is used to specify tests on an abstraction level of ViewModels.

## Details
Based on DSLs for specifying ViewModel APIs, a further DSL is created to create test cases on a higher abstraction layer. The test DSL then focuses on the ViewModel design, e.g., by invoking commands and asserting ViewModel fields.
