# Busy Flag for Asynchronous Operations

## Summary
Introduce a busy flag in the ViewModel to visualize that a long-running operation is running.

## Details
The busy flag can be used to visualize to a user, that a usecase/operation takes time. Actions can be disabled based on the busy flag to indicate that no conflicting operations shall be triggered, until the result is handled.

"How Do I Prevent the User from Doing Anything While an Asynchronous Operation is in Progress?
Generally, you will expose a property from the ViewModel named IsBusy. This is a Boolean value that your ViewModel can set to true when an asynchronous operation is in progress. You can then bind this IsBusy property to the IsBusy property on a BusyIndicator control in your View, which results in the BusyIndicator control appearing in the View when the ViewModelâ€™s IsBusy property is set to true. The BusyIndicator control serves two purposes: to inform the user that something is happening and to block the user from interacting with the View until the operation is complete. See Chapter 6 for more details on the BusyIndicator control."
