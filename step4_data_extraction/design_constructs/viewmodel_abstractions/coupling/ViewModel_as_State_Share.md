# ViewModel as State Share

## Summary
ViewModel is used to communicate/share state between multiple views.

## Details
The views might be shown at the same time (e.g., in a master detail sense).
Example: Left view has a textbox, where the input binds to the field "name". Right view observes the "name" for a label.
