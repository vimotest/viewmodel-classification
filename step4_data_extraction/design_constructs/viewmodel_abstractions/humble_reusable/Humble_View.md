# Humble View

## Summary
ViewModels are designed View aware / presentation-ready, such that View becomes mostly humble.

## Details
Humble view prioritizes that view has almost no presentation logic, by assuming that we do not have to reuse ViewModels for different views at all.
This is known as Passive View/Screen
