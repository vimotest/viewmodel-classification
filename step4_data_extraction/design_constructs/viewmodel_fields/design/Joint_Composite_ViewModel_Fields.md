# Joint/Composite ViewModel Fields

## Summary
ViewModel uses joint and composed fields for structured data.

## Details
Instead of designing fine-grained ViewModel fields like one for a user's name and one for the user's mail, the ViewModel field shall be a composite as DisplayableUser

## Resources
Example:
> if we need to display the name and the email address of a User, rather than creating two streams for this, we create a DisplayableUser object (MediumAndroidPatternsMvvm)
