# ViewModel without Model Types

## Summary
ViewModel exposes simple, model-independent types like Int and String.

## Details
The ViewModel does not expose model objects. This avoids a tight coupling between the view and the model.

## Resources
Example (ManferdiniMvvmSwift):
> What is important here is that our two views are entirely independent of our Item structure. Instead, they use simple Swift types like Int and String. This is an excellent practice to keep your types as loosely coupled as possible so that changes break as little code as possible.
