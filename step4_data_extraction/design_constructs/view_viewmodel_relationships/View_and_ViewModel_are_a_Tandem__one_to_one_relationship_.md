# View and ViewModel are a Tandem (one-to-one relationship)

## Summary
View and ViewModel are developed and maintained together, in a 1:1 relationship.

## Details
View knows the public interface of a ViewModel and is kept together, developed together. This leads to a coupling between the View and ViewModel, such that the ViewModel cannot be re-used for other views.
