# Navigation in View / Navigation System

## Summary
Navigation logic is placed in the view or a framework-specific navigation (workflow) system.

## Details
UI frameworks often provide routing/navigation features to realize the workflow of the application. The design construct is about using those workflow features for view navigation, instead of placing the responsibility to ViewModels.
