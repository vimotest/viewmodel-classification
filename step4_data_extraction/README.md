# Step 4: Data Extraction

In this step we extract the data from the scholar entries and website entries.
We use the MPS language to efficiently structure the data into a model.

## See Model

See https://github.com/Fumapps/mps-literature-review design constructs and trade-offs

## Generate Data to Markdown

Open project in MPS and generate "sandbox", see generated files under `<project-root>/languages/LiteratureReviewLang.sandbox/source_gen`

## Outcome

76 design constructs, 16 benefits, and 15 drawbacks.

## Next Step

See `step5_data_synthesis/README.md`
