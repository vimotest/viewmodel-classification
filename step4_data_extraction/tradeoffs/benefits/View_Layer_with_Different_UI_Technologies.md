# View Layer with Different UI Technologies

> Decoupling the view layer from the view-model layer gives the
advantage that the view layer can be implemented using different
UI technologies. The view model and model code can, for
instance, be reused in a MacOS application by simply substituting
the view layer. (MishraMvvm2017)
