## Summary
The View can be implemented with different UI technologies.

## Resources
> Decoupling the view layer from the view-model layer gives the

UI technologies. The view model and model code can, for
instance, be reused in a MacOS application by simply substituting
the view layer. (MishraMvvm2017)
