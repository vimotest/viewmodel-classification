# Less Imperative Code in View-Layer (Code-behind)

Through MVVM using a suitable UI-framework (e.g., WPF), it is possible to write less code-behind code. This can be reached by putting more code into declarative XAML.

> Less code: I've found that the amount of code required to manage the view has decreased quite a bit, as you no longer have to deal with boilerplate code behind code. This code involves a lot of casting and error checking in production quality code. Less code means fewer bugs, less code to maintain, and fewer unit tests to write.
