# Well-organized Design

Through MVVM, it is more easy to understand what views need from their ViewModels.

See MvvmSurvivalGuideSiddiqi2012:
> MVVM provides for well-organized, easy-to-understand designs. Your bindings are clear and easy to understand, as each view has a view model that it is bound to.
