# Usage of Third-Party Libraries affect Application Size/Performance/Learning Curve

## Summary
Using third-party libraries for MVVM implementations adds a new dependency to learn, and this additional dependency can increase the application size.

> The main disadvantages are as follows:
• If we use third-party libraries to perform the Data
Binding (such as RxSwift or Bond), we have to take
several factors into account:
• On the one hand, by adding an external library, we
are increasing the size of our app.
• On the other hand, the addition of these libraries
usually affects the performance of the applications.
* Finally, we must also take into account the learning
curve required to correctly use each of these
libraries.
