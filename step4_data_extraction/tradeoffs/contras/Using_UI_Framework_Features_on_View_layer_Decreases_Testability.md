> But first, a word of caution regarding the use of triggers in WPF and Silverlight when you implement the MVVM pattern: they should not be heavily used because they can easily incorporate presentation logic that canâ€™t be tested . The logic is not available in the ViewModel but it is exposed in the View with the trigger .
