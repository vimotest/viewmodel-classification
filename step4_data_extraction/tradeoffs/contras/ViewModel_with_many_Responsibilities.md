# ViewModel with many Responsibilities

Without proper design, ViewModels might blow up with many responsibilities, resulting in a "god class".
While this isn't a explicit drawback of MVVM, unexperienced developers might create this bad designed ViewModels without proper understanding.

The naming of MVVM components is ambiguous and can lead to suboptimal designs. 
E.g., since ViewModel is a weak name.
E.g., many developers put too many responsibilities into the ViewModel.
