Since the last update in 2015, the complex genomes of numerous Brassicaceae species have been decoded, accompanied by many omics datasets. To provide an up-to-date service, we report here a major upgrade of the portal. The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) framework of BRAD has been re-engineered to enable easy and sustainable maintenance of the database. The collection of genomes has been increased to 26 species, along with optimization of the user interface. Features of the previous version have been retained, with additional new tools for exploring syntenic genes, gene expression and variation data. In the ‘Syntenic Gene @ Subgenome’ module, we added features to view the sequence alignment and phylogenetic relationships of syntenic genes. New modules include ‘MicroSynteny’ for viewing synteny of selected fragment pairs, and ‘Polymorph’ for retrieval of variation data. The updated BRAD provides a substantial expansion of genomic data and a comprehensive improvement of the service available to the Brassicaceae research community.","",""

Android development comes with its own design practices and templates (layouts, activities, etc.). Developers also use different established architectural patterns for designing interactive software such as MVC, MVP and MVVM. They implement these patterns based on their understanding and experience. Thus, the choice and the implementation of such patterns varies from a developer to another. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that provides a comprehensive view of the use of these patterns in mobile apps. Moreover, there is no clear understanding of which pattern to use and what is the trend for designing mobile apps using such patterns. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to identify which MVC-based architectural pattern (MVC, MVP and MVVM) is used predominantly in a given app. For this purpose, we defined each of these patterns through a number of heuristics according to the pattern's potential implementations within the Android framework. We conducted an empirical study on a large set of mobile apps downloaded from the Google Play Store. We found, not surprisingly, a dominance of the popular MVC pattern, a rare use of MVP while MVVM is almost unused and a significant number of apps do not follow any pattern. The empirical study also enabled us to analyse the use of these patterns by domain, size and last-update date of the apps. We observed that MVC has been the most used pattern over the past years and it continues to gain popularity, and that small-size apps are mostly the ones that do not use any pattern.","",""

Starting from the actual needs of col-lege teaching, this paper designs a college teaching system based on various In-ternet information technologies. Specifically, the front end was developed under the lightweight progressive Vue.js framework, which relies on the model–view–view model (MVVM); the overall structure of the system was set up based on the browser-server (B/S) architecture; the system functions were realized through HTML5, Node.js and database technology; the compatibility between mobile terminal and desktop was realized under Bootstrap. The system test shows that the Vue.js-based college teaching system operated stably, achieved the design goals and satisfied user demand. The research findings shed important new light on modernization and quality of college teaching.","",""

The sheer number of different products that can be derived from PL points out to the scale of the challenge that Product Line Engineering (PLE) faces. Various development artifacts describe PL but due to their diversity, variability modeling across PL is a challenging task. Moreover, this complexity is a major obstacle for achieving traceability across PL which is especially important for product verification. In order to support systems engineering by establishing traceability across PL and aid verification planning we propose Multi-View Variability Model (MVVM). MVVM introduces a set of variability models that represent variability in various development artifacts, e.g. architecture, requirements etc. and corresponding inter-model constraints. We provide a formalization of MVVM and perform a transformation of the MVVM model to a Constraint Satisfiability Problem (CSP) where we formulate queries for the CSP model in order to extract information about variability dependencies among MVVM views. Throughout the paper we use a real system from the automotive domain as the working example in order to illustrate the introduced concepts.","",""

Several frameworks have been proposed to simplify the development of cross-platform mobile applications and, therefore, to reduce development and maintenance costs. Between them, cross-compiler mobile development frameworks, such as Xamarin from Microsoft, transform the application's code written in intermediate (aka non-native) language to native code for each target platform (Android, iOS). However, to our best knowledge, there is not much research about the advantages and disadvantages of the use of those frameworks during the development and maintenance phases of mobile applications. The objective of this paper is to present two datasets of questions and answers (Q&A) related to the development of mobile applications using Xamarin. Our datasets have 85,908 questions mined from the Xamarin Forum and 44,434 from Stack Overflow. To show their usefulness, we present two experiments. First, we replicate a study for discovering the main discussion topics of Xamarin development present in the two datasets using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and we compare them with topics previously reported about mobile development. Between the main topics discovered from those questions, we found that some of them are exclusively related to Xamarin and Microsoft technologies such as the design pattern 'MVVM'. Secondly, we aim at improving the official Xamarin documentation, which does not provide a complete description of the error codes that the Xamarin platform throws during development. We use our datasets of Q&A for complementing the error codes with information mined from accepted answers. We could complement the documentation of 23,9% of the error codes.","",""

In addition, the trend of miniaturization has allowed the development of new portable equipment, increasing the possibilities of point‐of‐use analysis at low cost. In this context, the objective of this study was to develop a portable analytical methodology using a low‐cost DLP NIRscan Nano spectrophotometer (Texas Instruments®) connected to a smartphone for data storage. For this, an app called NanoMetrix was developed, created natively for Android from Android Studio IDE, according to a software design standard known as Model‐View‐ViewModel (MVVM). To demonstrate the applicability of the method, 36 samples of plant tissue were analyzed to determine total nitrogen content. The calibration models were compared to those obtained with the SOLO+MIA software (Eigenvector Research, Inc.), 8.6.1. The results presented root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) 1.90 and 1.82 g kg−1, root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) 2.00 and 1.97 g kg−1, and R2pred 0.973 and 0.975, for the NanoMetrix application and the SOLO+MIA software, respectively. Therefore, the results indicate that the NanoMetrix integrated with the portable spectrophotometer, besides the acquisition of spectra, allows the processing of data in the field and reducing the time for the analysis and obtaining the results. Also, the chemometric associated with the NIR spectroscopy is a viable alternative to replace, or complement, the methods used for nitrogen determination.","",""

Nowadays, most developers tend to use MVC architectural pattern as this pattern is easy to use and separate the logic between model, view and controller. However, this architecture has common problems which are hard to test and manage the code because all the codes for business application are placed in controller components. Therefore, this paper reviewed some of the existing architectural patterns qualities specifically in testability, modifiability and performance quality in order to investigate the mentioned problems. By using Contact mobile apps as a case study, the results show the MVVM architecture is good for testability, modifiability (cohesion level procedural), and performance (memory consumption). In addition, VIPER is the best in modifiability (coupling level data and coupling level message) and performance of CPU.","",""

This pattern is composed of model, view and viewmodel, the problem of data swap between the model and the viewmodel is resolved by realizing INotifyPropertyChanged interface, and the model independent of the viewmodel is realized. In the while, the problem of event binding in view is resolved by realizing ICommand interface, combined with data binding, the viewmodel independent of the view is realized. Examples show that using the MVVM pattern to design the RIA system can realize the logical interface complete separate from the application logic and has a good capacity of automated testing.","",""

Microservice architecture and big data analysis and processing will become the innovation of technology in the new era. In this regard, it is very important to study a set of aquarium monitoring and management system based on microservice architecture, so that users can understand the changes in the environment in the aquarium, manage a large amount of historical data quickly, and help users solve existing problems. The design pattern of MVVM architecture, unified management of the life cycle, and microservice architecture make the system very easy to expand and maintain; secondly, it realizes the automatic monitoring of the aquarium environment while making multilevel storage optimization for a large amount of data and realizes fast retrieval of a large amount of data; finally, the system can make intelligent regulation in the environmental control of ornamental fish and can automatically adapt to the environmental requirements of different ornamental fish. Finally, the system can make intelligent control in the environment control of ornamental fish and can automatically adapt to the needs of different ornamental fish environments. After testing its server concurrent processing capability, communication stability, and Android performance, the system runs stably. This paper analyzes the architecture module reuse rate and protocol performance; the module reuse rate analysis results show that the various types of modules in the architecture are reused many times and have strong generality, which effectively reduces the development cycle and development cost, and the architecture can quickly and efficiently integrate hardware units such as sensors, actuators, and communication modules; the protocol performance analysis shows that the designed protocol has high communication performance and meets the architecture. The protocol performance analysis shows that the designed protocol has high communication performance and meets the requirements of the architecture in terms of the transmission rate. At the same time, the edge computing module of the architecture further shifts down the edge computing tasks and lays the hardware foundation for the subsequent implementation of sensor data anomaly detection, data encryption transmission, and other functions.","",""

Estimates suggest that by 2050, over 900 million people worldwide will have disabling hearing loss. The annual global cost of unaddressed hearing loss amounts to US$ 750 billion. Early detection of hearing loss can reduce its impact on an individual's life in addition to saving a huge cost. This paper, the second in a series of three papers, presents the type dependency architecture of an open-source application framework for hearing impairment diagnosis. The framework is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern which separates the development of graphical user interface (GUI) from the development of business and back-end logic. Some of the benefits of the MVVM pattern include reusable components, independent development of GUI and business or back-end logic, flexibility to modify GUI without having to change business or back-end logic, ease of unit testing, and reduced maintenance overhead. The proposed framework along with the open-source code makes it possible to easily extend the application functionality thus enabling other researchers and practitioners to develop their own versions of hearing loss diagnosis applications. The proposed software was evaluated by an otolaryngologist and found to be very beneficial in assisting a clinician to reach a hearing impairment diagnosis conclusion more methodically, swiftly and accurately.","",""

The proposed platform is capable of weight measurement based on electrical strain gauge weight pads and in-node data processing. Communication is wireless, with mesh networking. The developed vehicle weight measurement is one of subsystems applied in the TULCOEMPA project. It is required to cooperate with Structural Health Monitoring and Truck Recognition Systems. Due to the absence of mains line, all installations are powered by Hybrid Power System. The authors propose Energy Harvesting Controller cooperating with both solar panels and wind generators. The controller enables efficient energy harvesting from both power sources as well as monitoring of generated and consumed power levels. Next challenge was a design of vehicle weight data acquisition software architecture. The solution includes application of modern architectural concepts in software design, Representational State Transfer (REST), Model-View-View Model (MVVM) paradigm, and cloud computing.

This study explains a systematic solution to identify and diagnose interface faults during designing and integrating systems of systems. Because the systems targeted in this study are real underwater vessels, we first have anatomized 188 interface data transferred between 22 subsystems of them. Based on this, two interface data models are proposed, which include data sets regarding messages and inner fields and transition and decision functions for them. Specifically, a structure model at the message level evaluates how inner fields belong to a message, and a logic model at the field level assesses how each field is interpreted and if the interpreted value is understandable. The software that supports the modeling is implemented using the following concepts: (1) a model-view-viewmodel pattern for overall software design and (2) a computer network for representing sequential properties of field interpretations. The proposed modeling and software facilitate diagnostic decisions by checking the consistency between interface protocols and obtained real data. As a practical use, the proposed work was applied to an underwater shipbuilding project. Within 10 interfaces, 14 fault cases were identified and diagnosed. They were gradually resolved during the system design and integration phases, which formed the basis of successful submarine construction.","",""

However, there is no common or established strategy that developers can follow when implementing these patterns in their apps. In this context, analyzing existing mobile apps and identifying their implementations of the MVC pattern variants becomes important to understand the current practices in mobile apps. In this paper, we present a classification-based approach to identify MVC-based patterns in Android apps.

METHODS ACE is developed with C# using Microsoft .Net framework and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for elegant GUI design and smooth GUI transition animations through the integration of graphics engines and high dots per inch (DPI) settings on modern high resolution monitors. The industrial standard software design pattern, Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, is chosen to be the major architecture of ACE for neat coding structure, deep modularization, easy maintainability and seamless communication with other clinical software. ACE consists of 1) a patient data importing module integrated with clinical patient database server, 2) a 2D DICOM image and RT structure simultaneously displaying module, 3) a 3D RT structure visualization module using Visualization Toolkit or VTK library and 4) a contour evaluation module using supervised pattern recognition algorithms to detect contouring errors and display detection results. ACE relies on supervised learning algorithms to handle all image processing and data processing jobs. Implementations of related algorithms are powered by Accord.Net scientific computing library for better efficiency and effectiveness.   RESULTS ACE can take patient's CT images and RT structures from commercial treatment planning software via direct user input or from patients' database. All functionalities including 2D and 3D image visualization and RT contours error detection have been demonstrated with real clinical patient cases.   CONCLUSION ACE implements supervised learning algorithms and combines image processing and graphical visualization modules for RT contours verification. ACE has great potential for automated radiotherapy contouring quality verification. Structured with MVVM pattern, it is highly maintainable and extensible, and support smooth connections with other clinical software tools.","",""

The framework, called the Sensor Plot Kit (SPK), aims to help developers build apps for viewing sensor data that can be streamed in real-time or pre-recorded. It can handle multiple streams at relatively high data rates with short latencies, making it suitable for advanced medical applications such as electrocardiograms (ECG). This framework also supports filtering, post processing, and saving the data in non-volatile storage. A novel feature of our design is that we adopt the Model View View-Model (MVVM) design pattern that reduces complexity and maximizes code reusability compared to the standard Model View Controller (MVC) pattern in iOS while remaining compatible. Experimental results using a real-world ECG, on-board sensors, and pre-recorded results over actual and simulated iOS devices confirm that SPK enables developers to build feature-rich, robust apps that embed real-time, responsive plotting capability while significantly shortening development time. This work has the potential to make a crosscutting impact on science, engineering, medicine, the financial market, and many other fields that increasingly rely on smart phones and tablets as the primary device for viewing and interacting live and historical streams of data.","",""

The architecture is composed by five different function layers: CNC presentation Layer, CNC Business Layer, CNC Data Layer, NC Interface Layer and NCK Layer. Firstly, the WPF and the MVVM pattern decouple the User Interface (UI) presentation and business logic. Secondly, the component technology is used to decouple the business logic and Numerical Control(NC) functions. Thirdly, the implementation of NC tasks is put into non-RT environment and RT environment. The experiment results of developing the application based on the architecture show that the layered software architecture improves the maintenance and development efficiency, and running the application in the “non-RT+RT” environment proves that the architecture is available for PC-based master-slave CNC systems and soft-CNC systems.","",""

Almost all research is conducted mainly in the public sector, while private universities and companies usually do not conduct any research. Public higher education institutions are financed from the state budget and lack of funds is one of the main factors hindering the introduction of new information technologies and systems into the daily routine. Analysis of scientific achievements using bibliographic information has become a significant part of scientific and technical management in many countries around the world, but unlike Slovenia and Poland, Ukraine does not have a single bibliographic database and relevant search interfaces. Therefore, the aim of the work is to develop an automated bibliographic system that will simplify the process of creating, editing, searching, sorting, statistics, deleting bibliographic information of research and teaching staff and will automate the formation of personalized reports. To implement the proposed automated system, a review of existing databases of bibliographic information and search interfaces was conducted. It is concluded that they cannot provide Ukrainian scientists with the necessary functionality to form bibliographic descriptions of their own research papers. To design the architecture of a mobile application based on the Android operating system, a multi-level architecture class and an MVVM template were selected. Designed architecture contains three levels and five layers on which separate subsystems are located. The Pixel emulator and Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus smartphone were used to test the application on different screen sizes, as well as on different versions of the software interface. The application was developed in the AndroidStudio software environment. The design of the entered data according to two standards was implemented, namely: DSTU 8302-2015 and IEEE. Algorithms for searching and sorting records according to the necessary criteria are implemented. Saving the list of all necessary bibliographic descriptions in text format is implemented.

The creation of the Internet and web technologies has allowed this concept to reach a new level by creating a number of common international standards. In addition, to ensure control and exchange of bibliographic information public bibliographic and scientometric databases were created. Today, software for managing bibliographic records is in demand in various countries in Europe and America. The most popular software in these countries is EndNote, RefWorks, BibTeX and Zotero. The development of such automated bibliographic system and the adaptation of its functionality to standards and requirements within Ukraine is relevant for a number of reasons. The main reasons are the need for every scientist and lecturer of higher education institutions to confirm their scientific achievements when hiring, submitting scientific work to various competitions, to obtain a scientific degree and so on. Today the rapid development of information and computer technology allows us to abandon the list of scientific papers in manual mode and move to the use of specialized software on smartphones. That is why the architecture of an automated bibliographic system, which is developed as a mobile application based on the Android operating system, was designed. Java is chosen as the programming language in which the software will be written, as the vast majority of the Android operating system is written in this language. A number of technologies were chosen for the selected operating system. They will simplify the process of developing a mobile application. The three-layer architecture of the automated bibliographic system is designed on the basis of the multilevel model of architecture and the MVVM template. This architecture allows to provide the main non-functional characteristics of the quality of the developed software, as well as to effectively implement the rules of business logic within the object-oriented programming paradigm.","",""

For example, there are currently the KnockoutJS, BackboneJS and ReactJS frameworks competing together with the different (entirely different) versions of ‘Angular’ frameworks. While some of these new frameworks are more popular than others, some are specialised in certain types of applications, and others have spe-cific advanced features or outstanding capabilities that set them above others. Moreover, with the increase usage and demand of mobile applications, the need for cross-platform frameworks has significantly increased as well. In this paper, we discuss the different criteria which identifies the strengths and weaknesses of using each framework in developing mobile and web-applications. We highlight and discuss 12 different features of latest application frameworks as ‘points of comparison’. Then we compare 5 of the trending frameworks (KnockoutJS, BackboneJS, AngularJS, React and Angular2) in a thorough analysis based on our earlier defined points of comparisons i.e. features. Finally, we focus more deeply on the newly released Angular2 framework showing the eminent capabilities and values added over different trending frameworks and over its own earlier versions. Overall, our comparative analysis results in a few interesting findings regarding different current frameworks, leaving us to believe that a new generation might soon emerge from the exponential path of MVC, MV*/MVW and MVVM.","",""

The goal of the thesis is to use the form finding method dynamic relaxation to create a software application, which helps the layout engineers to automatically check whether an equipment transport route on offshore platforms is feasible using dynamic relaxation. This could potentially save a lot of time and add value by enabling the ability to run several iterations of the transport route with little effort. The thesis presents a new workflow, based on using the new application, and discusses advantages and disadvantages between the new and current workflow for transport route verification. By using Autodesk Navisworks and its .NET and COM API, a plug-in application was created for Navisworks, to automatically verify movement of an object through a given access way. This was done using Navisworks clash detective feature through the .NET API. The plug-in application required input parameter such as a validation object, a boundary geometry and a path. The plug-in application is divided into two phases; one path optimizing phase, and one verification phase. The optimizing phase is a pre-phase for the verification phase, to optimize run-time speed. The verification phase uses dynamic relaxation to try to move the validation object through the given path. If the validation object clashes with the boundary geometry, the dynamic relaxation will try to find a point of equilibrium where there is no clash. The plug-in application uses WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) as a presentation system in .NET, with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The visualization of the validation object’s movement, and the verification result, is done via Navisworks .NET API, where the movement is presented in Navisworks’ own UI. The plug-in application’s UI will present information about the status of a verification. The UI gives the opportunity for the user to monitor the velocity, acceleration and applied force in the dynamic relaxation method during verification using chart controls.","",""

This dissertation provide an overview on the planning and implementation of a graphical modeling tool of document flows to serve an existing platform to manage them. The document flow can be described as a document oriented process in opposition to business processes, BPM, which are oriented to business work routines. The first analysis of the problem was to understand the components that in which all the flow logic is divided. There are a set of elements, that define the flow design. In that set of elements there is a particular one, the operation, that can be associated to services/plug-ins, responsible to provide a certain automatism. In the second analysis was concluded that the set of elements is quite simple. The core of this platform is the the logic flexibility provided by the services associated to the automatic operations. The main goal of this project was to find a way to balance between the simplicity of the flow architecture logic with the perspective of this logic suffers a evolution, taking into account the users profiles and the maintainability. Although the standards chosen, BPMN (Business Process Modeling) and XPDL (XML Process Definition Language), provide the necessary means so that the flow can be defined and at the same time save some elements to cover the emergence of new components in the flow design, it was also necessary to take into account the case of this notation became unuseful for this platform. As a consequence, this solution was implemented under an layer architecture named MVVM (Model View View-Model), which abstracts the user interface and data model. The goals of this work were completed successfully, since it was built a solution using standard formats that ensures the necessary basis to define a flow under the rules that this platform demands. The definition of the flow was divided into modules that separate the draw logic and services logic, facilitating the maintenance and definition of each one of these components.","",""

Performance efficiency is measured based on CPU usage, memory usage, and execution Time. The case study shows that the CPU usage and execution Time on MVVM are smaller than Base architecture pattern from the AR Ruler. This is due to the third-party library RxSwift in the MVVM architecture that increases the application's response so that CPU usage and execution time is better than Base architecture pattern. However, the existence of the third-party library RxSwift has a negative impact on memory usage, resulting in higher memory usage than the Base Architecture Pattern.

Estimates suggest that by 2050, over 900 million people worldwide will have disabling hearing loss. The annual global cost of unaddressed hearing loss amounts to US$ 750 billion. Early detection of hearing loss can reduce its impact on an individual's life in addition to saving a huge cost. This paper, the first in a series of three papers, presents the design and features of an open-source application framework for hearing impairment diagnosis. The framework is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern which separates the development of graphical user interface (GUI) from the development of business and back-end logic. Some of the benefits of the MVVM pattern include reusable components, independent development of GUI and business or back-end logic, flexibility to modify GUI without having to change business or back-end logic, ease of unit testing, and reduced maintenance overhead. The proposed framework along with the open-source code makes it possible to easily extend the application functionality thus enabling other researchers and practitioners to develop their own versions of hearing loss diagnosis applications. The proposed software was evaluated by an otolaryngologist and found to be very beneficial in assisting a clinician to reach a hearing impairment diagnosis conclusion more methodically, swiftly and accurately.","",""

It is still not accepted by programmers as expected. Still maximum programmers are working with WPF and MVC. Now it’s time to work with MVVM. MVVM is advanced ASP.NET technology in which we discuss MVVM pattern and describes how to implement its fundamental characteristics. It is a part of smart web based programming. MVVM scenario is implemented using Prism Library. The MVVM pattern is a close variant of the Presentation Model pattern, optimized to leverage some of the core capabilities of WPF and Silverlight, such as data binding, data templates, commands, and behaviors. It is more reliable MVC (Model View Controller) with more advanced features that takes advantage of particular strengths of the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) architecture to separate the Model and the View by introducing an abstract layer between them a “Model of the View,” or ViewModel. In this paper we will discuss brief introduction, features, data binding, and programming of MVVM. Introduction MVVM Foundation is a library of classes that are very useful when building applications based on the ModelView-ViewModel philosophy. The library is small and concentrated on providing only the most indispensable tools needed by most MVVM application developers. ModelView-ViewModel is a way of creating client applications that leverages core features of the WPF platform, allows for simple unit testing of application functionality, and helps developers and designers work together with less technical difficulties. The classes in the MVVM Foundation are timetested tools in the toolbox of many WPF developers around the world. Now they all live in one convenient project. MvvmFoundation. The source code download also contains a set of unit tests and a demo application, which show how to use the classes. WPF lends itself toward MVVM which increase testability, flexibility and maintainability. The Model-View-ViewModel pattern helps us to cleanly separate the business and presentation logic of our application from its user interface (UI). Maintaining a clean separation between application logic and UI helps to address numerous development and design issues and can make our application much easier to test, maintain, and evolve. It can also greatly improve code re-use opportunities and allows developers and UI designers to more easily collaborate when developing their respective parts of the application. Using the MVVM pattern, the UI of the application and the underlying presentation and business logic is separated into three separate classes: the view, which encapsulates the UI and UI logic; the view model, which encapsulates presentation logic and state; and the model, which encapsulates the application's business logic and data. Prism includes samples and reference implementations that show how to implement the MVVM pattern in a Silverlight or Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application. The Prism Library also provides features that can help we implement the pattern in were own applications. These features embody the most common practices for implementing the MVVM pattern and are designed to support testability and to work well with Expression Blend and Visual Studio. The pattern was first introduced by John Gossman – the architect on the Blend/WPF/Silverlight team – and derives from the Smalltalk ApplicationModel pattern, as does the PresentationModel pattern described by Martin Fowler. It was first utilized by the Expression team (John was part of that team at the time) as they developed version 1 of Expression Blend.

A promising option for solving this problem is the use of convolutional neural networks.  The purpose of the study is to develop an automated system for diagnosing pneumonia from X-rays.  This paper presents research and development of software for the automated system for analysis and classification of X-ray images of the lungs in order to automatically determine the signs of the disease, in particular pneumonia, which is most relevant due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This work is an example of the creation of a decision support system that is designed to assist a doctor to make decisions, analyze X-ray images of the lungs, classify them, and also allows to store all the necessary information about patients in one repository.  For the automated system software was developed using C# and the user interface development environment - WPF. During the implementation process there were used the MVVM architecture and ML.NET as a tool for the neural network setup.

The activities such applications do while running on such devices consume energy and drain the device's battery. Many of these applications use REST API to communicate with their backend services running outside of the devices, primarily on the cloud. The paradigms like Model View View-Model (MVVM) used on the application side require data transformations that cause applications to consume more battery. There is a need for an improved approach and a paradigm that can be used to develop green software with reduced battery consumption. This paper proposes a novel Remote-Model View Remote-View-Model (RMVRVM) paradigm. The use of RMVRVM paradigm lowers the battery consumption on devices where the application is running and hence contributes to writing green software. In addition, RMVRVM makes an application more responsive and thus a delight to use. This paradigm has been implemented in industrial case studies, and significant gains in terms of the reduced amount of data transfer, reduced battery consumption, and faster response time were observed. Experiments were also done to further validate the paradigm with encouraging results. The practitioners can apply the RMVRVM to design applications for battery-constrained devices with smaller energy footprints and better response times.","",""

Specifically, the system consists of a remote data service platform, the data collection terminals build on Raspberry Pi and the wireless data transmission using narrow-band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) modules. The data service platform is designed with the separated front-end and rear-end. The front-end is a web page constructed by the Vue.js and Element, while the rear-end business logic processing is constructed using the Python Django framework. The data interaction between the front and rear ends is realized through Axios. In such a way, the data in the front-end and the rear-end are decoupled, which makes it possible to improve the capability in dealing with complex data and makes it easy to carry out add-on development and extend new functions. Based on the data service platform, a series of basic application functions are integrated, including real-time data monitoring, historical data query, data visualization and abnormal data alerting, etc. Moreover, we integrate a deep-learning-based plant disease and pest detection algorithm in the propose system to show its scalability.

MVVM frameworks have attempted to simplify this process, by offering atemplate language that enables the declarative specification of dashboards, and by automaticallymaintaining the displayed visualizations when the visualized data change. These frameworks,however, still exhibit significant drawbacks. When mutations occur in underlying data sources,developers have to observe and manually propagate (using imperative code) said mutations tothe framework, which still requires advanced skill-set and experience in web development. Additionally, even though these frameworks automatically mutate the dependent visualizations (thusabsolving developers from manually performing this task), once mutations have been propagatedto the framework, their incremental rendering algorithms incur significant performance penalties,especially when visualizing big data.To address these issues, we present FORWARD, a framework that simplifies the development of custom live dashboards. FORWARD offers a declarative template languagethat simplifies the integration of (a) database and web service systems (such as Postgres andGraphQL), (b) visualization libraries (such as Google Maps and HighCharts), and (c) dataprocessing functions (performing aggregations, ML computations, and more), thus enabling atruly declarative specification of dashboards. This significantly lowers the technical expertiseneeded for dashboard development, thus allowing programmers with limited experience in webdevelopment (such as data analysts), to produce custom, information-dense, highly-reactivedashboards. FORWARD templates describe dashboards as semi-structured views. As a result,when mutations occur in the base-data of such views, FORWARD employs novel incrementalview maintenance techniques, that automatically propagate changes from data sources all theway to the visual layer more efficiently than existing frameworks.In this Thesis, we illustrate FORWARD’s template language and incremental renderingalgorithms, and show their superior algorithmic complexity compared to the state of the art.Experimental results validate the complexity results and show that FORWARD’s incrementalrendering can be orders of magnitude more efficient than existing approaches. Line-of-code anddevelopment time experiments show that the performance gains are accompanied by productivitygains for developers that use FORWARD to build information-dense dashboards. Lastly, wepresent ViDeTTe, a system that integrates FORWARD with Jupyter notebooks, and enables dataanalysts to build Jupyter Notebooks with reactive visualizations. Notebook readers can thendirectly interact with these visualizations to further explore the underlying data, a functionalitythat is currently not supported in Jupyter Notebooks.","",""

Such frameworks, typically, provide algorithms that automate the maintenance of the application’s view when mutations occur to the underlying data (also known as model). The automation of this process, commonly referred to as Application View Maintenance (AVM), significantly improves developer productivity, since it alleviates the developer from manually performing this task. Such algorithms are also capable of mutating individual parts of the view when the underlying data mutate, thus avoiding a full reload and rerendering of the entire application view, (a very expensive operation for HTML content, especially in the mobile setting). However, as we show in this work, AVM algorithms of existing MVVM frameworks are still suboptimal performance-wise. By continuously exploring the model for mutations, they have a complexity that is proportional to the size of the model and not to the size of mutations. This suboptimality combined with the low computational power of mobile devices, can lead to severely inefficient mobile apps, which can also impact the user experience. To address this issue, we propose a novel AVM algorithm which uses existing incremental view maintenance techniques, to directly identify the mutated parts of the model and infer the respective parts of the view that need to be updated, while avoiding a blowup in complexity proportional to the size of the model of the application. The complexity and memory consumption of the proposed algorithm are shown to be typically significantly lower than existing approaches.","",""

Using real-time hydraulic and water quality measurements and run-time models, NetSafe is capable of identifying the presence of contaminants and predicting their sources and destinations in DWDS for vulnerability analysis and optimal emergency response. NetSafe uses a model-based anomaly detection approach that can be used with any type of sensor. The contaminant source identification leverages the Contaminant Status Algorithm (CSA), and the contaminant spread is determined using the EPANET MSX engine. NetSafe has been developed as .NET application written in C#. It is based on a robust design pattern called “Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)” that permits scalability as well as flexibility. The user interface can be completely defined using an XML like syntax called the eXtensible Application Markup Language (XAML). NetSafe has the ability to connect to relational databases to obtain SCADA data, and it has been tested with both Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and Microsoft Access 2003. The results displayed by NetSafe were independently verified using an Excel-based workbench. The architecture evolved through the creation of use case diagram, class diagram, communication diagram, sequence diagram, state activity diagram. These capabilities of NetSafe were tested using “Network 3” from the EPANET sample data and multispecies water quality kinetics, and the initial results appear to be promising. The next phase of research will compare NetSafe with existing approaches using real-life networks.","",""

However, some applications built on android tend to have a cumbersome interface causing inconveniences to users. This can be reduced by eliminating the redundancies during the build of these applications. List view is commonly used in android applications to arrange a list of scrollable items in a sequential order. This consumes a considerable amount of memory and CPU utilization resulting in the degradation of the applications. One proposed solution to this can be the introduction of the RecyclerView. The RecyclerView traditionally replaces the GridView and the ListView which were previously used in android applications. This improvement is achieved by recycling the views which are out of the visibility of the user inturn enhancing both the ListView as well as the GridView. Networking in android was previously a nightmare for developers where they had to retrieve and analyze their own data. Data transfer is performed in Android applications using a Web REST API. Development speed can be enhanced by efficient data analysis by utilizing a library from the entire range of REST client libraries. REST (Representational State Transfer) has become the most commonly used way for creating, publishing, and consuming Web services, exploiting JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as a data exchange format. The most used libraries for accessing the REST Web APIs today are Android Volley and Retrofit. An android device is hindered by limited power, memory and resources. Several architectures such as MVC(Model-View-Controller), MVP(Model-view-Presenter) and MVVM(ModelView-Viewmodel) are commonly used in the development of android applications. In order to develop applications with efficient CPU utilization, reduced memory usage and a lowered execution time, the most suitable of these architectures is to be utilized","",""

Durch die ansteigende Komplexitat sind neue Konzepte fur die Hilfestellung und Beratung erforderlich, welche sowohl der breiten Masse von Empfangsgeraten als auch den Sicherheitsstandards einer E-Banking Losung gerecht werden. Das Co-Browsing ermoglicht es dem Kundenberater, entweder seine eigene Anzeige dem Kunden freizugeben, oder die Anzeige seines Kunden zu ubernehmen. Dabei wird nicht wie bei herkommlichen Fernwartungs-Losungen der Zugriff auf das gesamte System gewahrt, sondern nur auf die aktuelle Anzeige innerhalb des Webbrowsers. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurde vorerst eine Evaluation bestehender Co-Browsing Losungen durchgefuhrt, welche ergab, dass der Stand der heutigen Technologien fur einen Einsatz in einer produktiven E-Banking Umgebung noch nicht genugend ausgereift ist. Aus diesem Grund wurde die Losung als Prototyp in einer simulierten E-Banking Plattform implementiert. Zwischen den Browsern (Kunde/Berater) wird eine Verbindung uber WebSockets hergestellt und mittels Nachrichten Informationen ubertragen. Um auf Anderungen der Anzeige (z.B. Seitenwechsel) zu reagieren, wird das Document Object Model (DOM) uberwacht und bei Mutationen werden Events ausgelost, um die Gegenstelle abzugleichen. Die Serverseite (WebSockets) wurde in JavaScript (Node.js) implementiert. Der Server stellt zum einen die Kommunikation zwischen Kunde und Berater uber Channels sicher und beinhaltet zum anderen eine Datenstruktur fur das Persistieren der Informationen. Um auf der Clientseite eine grossere Web-Applikation simulieren zu konnen (z.B. clientseitiges Routing, Login) wurde das JavaScript Framework AngularJS verwendet. Dies erlaubt es, die Applikation sinnvoll zu strukturieren und auch im JavaScript Umfeld Paradigmen wie MVC/MVVM und Dependency Injection einzusetzen. Die Businesslogik wurde in Services gekapselt und erlaubt somit eine hohe Wiederverwendbarkeit.","",""

Hinter Xamarin steht das Mono Framework, eine Open Source Implementierung des Microsofts .NET Framework, welches im Jahr 2001 erstmals veroffentlicht wurde. Der Vorteil von Xamarin ist, dass native Applikationen fur alle drei fuhrenden mobilen Plattformen mit der gleichen Programmiersprache C# entwickelt werden konnen. Xamarin hat die Schnittstelle von Android und iOS mit regularen C# Klassen gekapselt. Entwickler profitieren von der modernen Programmiersprache C# und deren Funktionalitaten wie LINQ, funktionalen Lambda Ausdrucken und Generics. Im Gegensatz zu Web Apps wird das User Interface pro Plattform separat programmiert. Dadurch wird das gewunschte Benutzererlebnis erreicht und es konnen auch leistungskritische Anwendungen wie Spiele programmiert werden. Als primares Ziel gilt das gemeinsame Nutzen von Code. Mit Hilfe von portablen Klassenbibliotheken ist es moglich, den gleichen Code fur alle drei Plattformen zu nutzen. Eine saubere Trennung zwischen dem User Interface und dem Business Layer ist erstrebenswert. Um dies zu erreichen, muss das Model-View-ViewModel Muster (MVVM) plattformubergreifend genutzt werden konnen. Das Framework MvvmCross stellt hierfur einige Bibliotheken zur Verfugung. Nachdem die Grundlagen von Xamarin und MvvmCross bekannt waren, stand die Portierung der bestehenden Windows Phone App „MeteoCheck.ch“ auf Android und iOS im Vordergrund. Die Applikation bietet nebst den aktuellen Wetterprognosen auch zusatzlich Informationen wie zum Beispiel Lawineninformationen, Sonnenstand und Live Kamera Bilder. Nach einer grundlichen Analyse wurde das vorhandene Projekt in eine portable Klassenbibliothek und in ein Windows Phone Projekt aufgeteilt. Die portable Klassenbibliothek enthalt alle ViewModels und ist fur die Kommunikation mit dem Web Server zustandig. MvvmCross hat zudem einen IoC Container und ein Navigation Controller implementiert, wodurch die Navigation der einzelnen Ansichten uber die ViewModels gesteuert werden kann. Die grosste Schwierigkeit bestand fortan bei der Entwicklung der einzelnen User Interfaces. Bei der Android Entwicklung war dies vergleichsweise einfach, da Java Implementierungen fast identisch mit C# abgebildet werden konnten. Bei iOS Applikationen mit der nativen Programmiersprache Objectiv-C, war dies durch den gesetzten zeitlichen Rahmen schwieriger, was fur den weiteren Verlauf bedeutete, dass der Android Prototyp erweitert wurde. Abschliessend kann gesagt werden, dass mit Xamarin gute Applikationen entwickelt werden konnen, sofern die notwendigen Kenntnisse uber die Architektur und den Lebenszyklus der jeweiligen Plattformen vorhanden sind.","",""

Die Datenbank wird vom Server uber Linq to SQL angesprochen. Die ganze Applikation ist in C# geschrieben. Ergebnis: Der Prototyp zeigt, dass sich Silverlight schon sehr gut fur professionelle Anwendungen einsetzen lasst. Eine einfache Bedienung wurde durch ein ubersichtliches und einfaches Design mit selbsterklarenden Controls (durch Tooltips, Bilder, etc) erreicht. Der Benutzer bekommt vom User Interface Inputs zu wichtigen Aktionen (durch Bilder, Animation, etc). Das Trennen der verschiedenen Schichten durch das MVVM Pattern, WCF und Linq to SQL fuhrt zu einer guten Wartbarkeit der Applikation. Die Skalierbarkeit von Silverlight ist stark von Animationen abhangig. Durch auslagern des Zeichnen der aufwandigen Animationen auf die GPU und einstellen einer tieferen Framerate wurde hier eine Leistungssteigerung erreicht. Aus Zeitmangel wurde die serverseitige Skalierung nicht vertieft betrachtet, was eine gute Aufgabe fur Folgearbeiten ware. Die Sicherheit der Applikation ist die grosse Aufgabe, welche noch stark verbessert werden muss, da sie nur sehr rudimentar implementiert wurde.","",""

The scenario data of different dimensions (e.g., administrative levels, sectors, granularities, and time) have become highly integrated. Accordingly, a structural and systematic model is needed to represent waterlogging scenarios for more efficient waterlogging response decision-making. In this article, a full-view urban waterlogging scenario is first defined and described from four dimensions. Next a structured representation of scenario element is given based on knowledge unit method. The full-view scenario model is then constructed by extracting the scenario correlation structures between different dimensions (called scenario nesting), i.e., inheritance nesting, feedback nesting, aggregation nesting, and selection nesting. Finally, a real-world case study in Wuhan East Lake High-tech Development Zone, China is evaluated to verify the reasonability of the full-viewmodel. The results show that the proposed model effectively integrates scenario data from different dimensions, which helps generate the complete key scenario information for urban waterlogging decision-making.

In literature, vast amount of algorithms are proposed based on model-based approach or view-based approach which results in inaccurate data for 3D representation of digital content. In this work, collaboration of both viewmodel relevance among 3D objects for retrieval and 3D objects perception is performed based on various graph structures. Object hypergraph structure (view information) is implemented at initial stage to perceive the 3D objects in multiple views and an object graph is constructed for model data for obtaining the information about the relationship between the different features of the obtained 3D objects.

One aspect of this role is to deliver tools based on those models to trading and sales staff, which they can use to quickly price proposed transactions and perform other analysis of market conditions. Historically these tools have been delivered as Excel spreadsheets.  WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) is a GUI framework which encourages architectural separation between the layout of the user interface itself (the ""View"") and the underlying interactions and calculations (the ""ViewModel"" and ""Model""). We have built a framework for developing tools in WPF that makes use of a graph-based calculation engine for implementing ViewModels and Models in F#. The engine is built on F# asynchronous workflows and provides a standard set of features to our tools. In this talk I'll discuss the implementation of this calculation engine, including various steps in its evolution that led up to our use of asynchronous workflows. I'll also talk about how well F# and asynchronous workflows have worked for us, and briefly discuss some of the challenges of integrating F# and WPF.","",""

The vessels and nerves are numerically labeled in the output image, and the index is provided beside the image. The online video shows the demonstration of the method (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, Video 1, http://links.lww.com/DSS/A889). The placement of the masks depends on the recognition of facial keypoints in the photograph. Therefore, we recommend the use of focused sharp portrait photographs either in the proper natural lighting or the use of flash. The photographs can be obtained by using either a smartphone or a digital camera. To avoid the distortion of the face, we also recommend taking the photographs from at least a half meter distance from the subject. This method uses the concept of detecting specific facial landmarks rather than detecting the whole face or trying to recognize the individual. This allows for the proper placement of the anatomical structures over the image. There are several limitations of this method. The face of some individuals may be disproportionate, which might alter the placement of the masks. In addition, the position and course of vessels and nerves of the face of different individual vary. Therefore, the results of this method should currently be used in the educational setting rather than a clinical one. However, the method could be improvised by collecting the information about the different variations of the course of vessels and nerves to construct “bands” of their course rather than definite lines. These bands could then be overlaid on the images to guide the clinician regarding the possible courses of the specific structure. Additional improvement of this method could include improving the accuracy of the ML model using a larger data set and using individual masks for the different vessels and nerves. Similarly, a lateral viewmodel could also be developed. Another use case scenario could be the overlaying of the facial muscles and underlying bones on the image. Being able to overlay these structures on an actual patient’s/subject’s photograph could make educational sessions of the use of botulinum toxins and facial fillers more interactive.","",""

A pivotal gauge of an application’s success rests on its practical utility in daily life, coupled with its demonstrated strong performance metrics. There are several performance metrics to evaluate the performance of an application, such as RAM usage, CPU utilization, and their impact on battery life. Additionally, it is crucial to consider the User Interface (UI) factor, which serves as the primary connection between users and applications. Beyond its role as a bridge between users and applications, the UI can also significantly affect the performance of an application, as rendering a UI often takes a considerable amount of time. Various approaches can be employed to enhance the rendering time of a UI, one of which involves the use of design patterns like Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), which effectively separate the business logic from the UI layer. This research study compares the performance of these two design patterns in the context of UI rendering time. The findings of this study confirm that MVVM outperforms MVC significantly in rendering UI components more rapidly. This superiority is attributed to MVVM’s inherent ability to isolate business logic, ultimately reducing rendering delays. Furthermore, MVVM’s prominent data binding feature further strengthens its efficiency in terms of UI rendering time.","",""

Many architectural patterns are available in present but there are few empirical data that support a specific choice; therefore, this paper makes a practical thorough analysis of three of the existing architectural patterns in order to prove which of them is better to be used in iOS mobile applications development. The three architectures compared in this study are Model-View-Controller (MVC), which is Apple's recommended architecture and is also the oldest and most widely used one; Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), which comes as a solution to the limitations of MVC; Model-View-Intent (MVI) which is used together with SwiftUI and a state machine, to achieve a reactive application considering current trends to this style of programming. Analysis of the resulting performance and testability was done by developing a case-study application in each of these three architectures. For assuring an objective comparison, performance benchmarks have been executed to monitor the memory and CPU. Aside from the performance, testability represents another key point which is analysed in the paper, by using the metrics represented by the amount of code required to implement testing the core functionalities of the application and test coverage.

Fake attendance is a major issue to be addressed. Existing bio-metric system is a decent solution but they have limited functionality and have many vulnerabilities. Our objective is to provide an efficient and scalable cloud-based solution with facial recognition which can detect fake attendance and provide alerts to the management in case of irregular attendance. Our solution follows a verification process to avoid fake attendance. Initially, students have to upload a photo with their ID cards into our application. Next, the teacher or supervisor of the class will take a group photo of all the students and upload them into cloud through a mobile application, which will act as a user interface of our solution. The cloud architecture deployed in our solution combines various services like Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Simple Storage Service, Amazon Relational Database Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Amazon Lambda, Amazon Textract and Amazon Amplify in the most efficient manner in terms of storage and cost by regular deletion of unwanted data. We can then use the required cloud services to compare the faces of the student’s photo saved in our database with the group photo uploaded by the teacher to detect the students who are present. The proposed solution also analyzes the historical data within the database to prepare an aggregated report that consists of various fields like frequency of irregularity in attending classes, subject balance score and average attendance. While the back-end of the application is deployed in cloud, the front-end will be handled using Android as 70% of the general populace are dependent on this platform. Our solution uses Model-View-View-Model (MVVM) architecture. Execution time in MVVM applications is faster due to it supporting data binding with an average difference of 126.21ms.","",""

This surge in resource depletion and environmental pollution exerts an adverse influence on the well-being of individuals, while impeding societal progress and hindering the enhancement of overall quality of life. Within the domain of urban environmental design, the integration of visual displays emerges as a superior approach to facilitate the assimilation and analysis of green and low-carbon information. However, urban environmental data usually contains multiple dimensions, so it is a problem to realize the data representation of multiple dimensions while maintaining the correlation and interactivity between data. To surmount the challenge of visualizing such intricate information, this investigation initially employs a sophisticated memory-based clustering algorithm for information extraction, accompanied by a global similarity algorithm that meticulously computes attribute component quantities within specific dimensions of the vector. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent power of Vue’s bidirectional data binding capabilities, the study adopts the esteemed MVVM (Model-View-View-Model) pattern, fostering seamless two-way interaction through the established logical relationship. As a result, the amalgamation of multidimensional visualization technology empowers comprehensive data mining through a captivating visual augmentation. Concurrently, the application of data visualization dimension control delivers tailored displays tailored to green and low-carbon scenarios within urban environmental design. Experimental results impeccably validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, substantiated by a mere 1.77% false alarm rate for data stream difference detection and a clustering difference of 1.34%. The aforementioned algorithm accentuates the efficacy of visual displays, thus engendering a profound synergy between the industrial and supply chains. Moreover, it facilitates the design, production, and utilization of environmentally friendly products and energy sources. This, in turn, serves as a catalyst, propelling the widescale adoption of green and low-carbon practices throughout the entire industrial chain, fueled by the seamless integration of multimedia data.","",""

These advertisements will later be shown in public places, such as supermarkets, cafes, malls, and others. The problem faced by Digiprom is that there is no information technology to help interact between Digiprom and its clients (businessman). The interactions in question are such as registration as a client, the process of making a contract between the client and Digiprom, the process of monitoring the contract that has been made and the delivery of other information about Digiprom. To solve this problem, an Android-based mobile application will be developed to help Digiprom interact with its clients. This research focuses on the development side of the Android application, while the server side is not included in this study. The development of this application will use the Waterfall method and tested using black box testing and user acceptance testing. The system design is described using three UML diagrams, namely use case diagrams, activity diagrams and class diagrams. Program code written using Kotlin language with MVVM architecture (Model, View, ViewModel). There are three main objects in this system, namely users (businessman/clients), ads (advertisements) and location (advertising locations). Each object will have its own repository. The repository has three data sources, namely network (server), Room Database, and Data Store. The use of MVVM architecture facilitates the development and maintenance process, because if there is a change in the data structure of an object, it will not affect the data structure of other objects. The results of this research (Android application) will be uploaded to the Google Play Store under the name Digiprom.","",""

Rejecting such actions signifies an ethical decision grounded in moral values, not solely in intellectual pursuits. This illustrates that intelligence is not confined to intellectual acumen alone but also encompasses moral intelligence. The importance of measuring moral intelligence becomes evident here. Questionnaires or scales can be employed to gauge an individual's comprehension, awareness, and moral judgment concerning moral situations or dilemmas. The Moral Competency Inventory (MCI), developed by Lennick, Kiel & Jordan, serves as a tool to assess strengths and weaknesses in moral intelligence, comprising 40 questions encompassing 10 moral competencies. This research aims to innovate by measuring an individual's level of moral intelligence through an Android-based application that adopts the MCI instrument. The research method used is Research and Development (R&D) with the ADDIE approach. The SiCeMor application has been successfully designed using Kotlin programming language and MVVM architecture. The Sicemor application has undergone stages of functionality, performance, data security, and device compatibility testing, ensuring accuracy in final score calculations, live data display, navigation between screens, and resource usage such as CPU and memory. Sicemor application is now officially launched on the Google Play Store account.","",""
