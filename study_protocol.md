# Study Protocol for Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) on MVVM

## Title
Exploring Design Variants of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Pattern: A Multivocal Literature Review

## Background and Motivation

Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a popular architectural pattern for GUIs, but its flexible design leads to varied implementations.
This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these design variants and the associated trade-offs.
The MLR is conducted in the context of the main author's PhD research about MVVM-based GUI testing, aiming to contribute to the body of knowledge on MVVM and inform both academia and industry practitioners.

## Objectives and Research Questions

### Objectives
- Identify different MVVM design variants.
- Explore the trade-offs mentioned by developers in applying MVVM.

### Research Questions
1. Which design variants do developers use when implementing MVVM?
2. Which trade-offs do developers mention when applying MVVM?

## Methodology

### Number of Researchers
One researcher (the main author) conducted the MLR.

### Role and Contributions
The main author performed the MLR, including:
- Reading and voting on all sources.
- Creating all artifacts.

### Search Process
- **Databases and Search Engines**: Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Google for gray literature.
- **Keywords and Search Terms**: "mvvm", "model-view-viewmodel", "viewmodel", "view model".
- **Initial Pool of Sources**: 519 scholar entries and 523 website entries.

### Quality Assessment
- **Manual Voting**: Scholar entries manually scanned and voted for relevance.
- **AI-based Automated Voting**: Websites filtered using AI-based automated voting with ChatGPT.

## Data Extraction and Synthesis
- **Data Extraction Tools**: Custom classification scheme developed using JetBrains MPS.
- **Data Synthesis**: Qualitative analysis to identify and categorize design constructs and trade-offs.

## Publication Bias and Limitations
- **Publication Bias**: Mitigated by including both gray and white literature.
- **Limitations**: Potential biases in manual and AI-based voting, non-deterministic AI tool results.

## Results
The results of the MLR, including identified design variants and trade-offs, are detailed in the main research paper.
Artifacts and data are available in the replication package.

## Timeline and Milestones
- **Planning Phase**: Q1 2023.
- **Search and Filtering**: Q1 2023, Q4 2023.
- **Data Extraction and Synthesis**: Q2 2023 - Q1 2024.
- **Drafting and Reporting**: Q2 2024.

## Dissemination and Reporting
- **Target Conference**: EDOC 2024: 28th International Conference on Enterprise Design, Operations and Computing, 9-13th September 2024, Vienna, Austria.
