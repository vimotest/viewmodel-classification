You need expertise in architectural patterns, focusing on GUI architectures like MVC, MVP, MVVM.
Your audience: software engineering researchers studying software architecture.
Goal: Determine if websites provide the standard MVVM definition or a deviation.

MVVM Standard Definition:
MVVM separates business and presentation logic from UI.
Variant of MVC; ViewModel abstracts the View.
Model: application data and logic.
View: visual elements and interactions.
ViewModel: Model for data-binding, data-transformers, and commands.
Data-binding: one-way or two-way; loose coupling between View and ViewModel.
ViewModel doesn't reference View; Model unaware of ViewModel and View.
MVVM: guidelines, not strict rules.
ViewModel-View association varies: View-first, ViewModel-first, ViewModel locator.
Benefits: clear separation, easier testing, focused development. Drawbacks: overkill for simple UIs, challenging ViewModel design, data-binding issues.

Focus Points:
Focus on conceptual, framework-independent definitions.
Ignore misunderstandings about business logic storage.
Ignore specific examples (Android, iOS, WPF, etc.).
Reject incomplete definitions as "No Definition".
Ignore non-generalizable, tool-specific details.
Extensions include: design variants, new responsibilities, benefits/drawbacks, View-ViewModel cardinality, ViewModel granularity, reuse details, navigation logic, lifecycle management, UI threading, asynchronous presenter logic.

Categories:
A: Standard MVVM Definition
B: Deviation from Standard
C: Extended Benefits/Drawbacks
D: No MVVM Definition
E: Undefined Category
Mark tool/framework usage with "". E.g., A for standard MVVM in WPF context.
A and B are mutually exclusive.
Identify website type: personal blog, company blog, documentation, tutorial, forum, etc.
Optimize the Task:

Review the provided URLs.
Extract category, website type, and reasoning.
Summarize content concisely (max. 50 words) using bullet points.
Now, please provide the website URLs, and I'll proceed with the analysis based on the optimized instructions.

Here are the websites, loop over all of them:
https://intellitect.com/blog/getting-started-model-view-viewmodel-mvvm-pattern-using-windows-presentation-framework-wpf/
https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/MVVM-Samples
https://upday.github.io/blog/model-view-viewmodel/
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/model-view-viewmodel-android-tutorial/
https://malcoded.com/posts/angular-2-components-and-mvvm/

Finally, generate a overview table with the columns: URL, Category, Type, Deviation/Extension Aspects, Benefits, Drawbacks, Technology, Reason

Use the results you already analysed per URL, do not re-interpret things differently.
