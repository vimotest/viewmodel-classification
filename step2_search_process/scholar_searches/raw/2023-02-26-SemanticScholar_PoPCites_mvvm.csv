Heuristic evaluation is used to test ten usability aspects of the application and a severity rating to determine the magnitude of the user interface problems of the application. There are problems with usability in the TA mobile application. It was starting from the current user interface display, which is unresponsive (88%). Furthermore, some icons do not match the icon name and information (83%). There is an accumulation of information on one page, especially on the home page, where users need excessive scrolling (72%). So it is necessary to redesign the user interface design in order to meet user needs. This study aims to determine the suitability of the TA trial mobile application with user requirements through requirements elicitation (observation and questionnaires) and testing with heuristic evaluation & severity rating to measure the usability of the TA mobile application. This research has produced seven Functional Requirements, four Non-Functional Requirements, and Use Case diagrams involving three actors and eleven Use Cases. In addition, for the MVVM implementation, we have implemented interface design, for example, applied to the LoginAction class to avoid using ENUM. The implementation of View on ‘SignInButton,’ ‘usernameView,’ and ‘passwordView’ to create actions and states, and implementation of RxViewModel as the basis of all ViewMode. In the final stage of this research, usability and severity measurements have been successfully carried out, which are included in the category with a rating = 1 (cosmetic problem).","",""

The use of the right architecture is expected to produce good performance for android devices when running an application. Therefore, the author conducted a study on whether the application of the MVVM architecture pattern by changing the program code with the refactoring method will affect memory usage, CPU, and code execution time in Android-based applications.

It encourages the development of the software components by the different independent teams and easy integration at the final stage. The individual researcher prefers direct coding or tightly coupled software modules. The Model is rapid and efficient but might create maintainability issues later. So from day one, we should introduce the best design model. In this scenario, the MVVM model is the major player. Here, we present how to implement MVVM into our project through a simple task. We will design the user interface, which is part of the UX design team, and then add functionality, which is the programming part. Finally, we will do integration and execution. The code used in this project is available to download from GitHub.  Design/Methodology/Approach: We are creating a C# WPF project inside the visual studio community edition. Then we segregate our activity into two parts. In the first part, we make a Model for our project. After that, we design the user interface. The user interface interacts with the user to display the data and receive inputs from the user. It is the presentation or view layer. After completing it, we add the required view model interaction logic. Finally, we integrate all components and run the project.  Findings/Result: Through the research, we realize the importance of the MVVM concept. It is a good software architecture; the researcher who has gone through the documents will find out how to implement the MVVM into their project. Some essential procedures are presented concisely so they can be adopted quickly. This architecture is independent of any language. So once we grab it, it can be implemented in our project, whatever the language we use. Originality/Value: Several documents on MVVM design using WPF are available worldwide. Most of the documents are elaborative and descriptive. It is tricky to extract the required information from long-duration content as fast-track space. Here we demonstrate practically. Using the documents as a reference, the researcher can easily integrate the MVVM concept into their project.  Paper Type: Experimental-based Research.","",""

Previous studies have measured performance among the three architectures, and it can be concluded that the performance of MVC < (MVP = MVVM), but between MVP and MVVM which is better is still unclear. This study aims to compare the performance of MVP and MVVM architectures measured from 3 (three) aspects, namely CPU usage, memory usage, and execution time. Based on experiments, the results show that MVVM performance is better at CPU usage and execution time, while MVP is better at memory usage. CPU usage in MVVM applications is lower with an average difference of 0.55%. Execution time in MVVM applications is faster with an average difference of 126.21 ms, while memory usage in MVP applications is lower with an average difference of 0.92 Mb. This happens because the MVVM architecture has an additional library (in the form of a data-binding) that can increase application response so that CPU usage and execution time are better, but another impact is its memory usage is higher than MVP.","",""

The Model-View-ViewModel or MVVM pattern is a design pattern that can be used to design structure of software which comprises three components. The Model component holds application data. The View component displays visual elements and controls on the screen. The ViewModel component is the intermediary between the Model and View and transforms model information for display on a view. The advantages of this pattern are that there is a clear separation between domain logic in the Model and the display on the View, and tests and maintenance of different components are facilitated. However, there are several developers in a software development team, and not all developers use the MVVM pattern. This makes the code not compliant with the pattern and affects code maintenance. To help developers to revise the code to comply with the MVVM pattern, this paper has studied the MVVM design pattern, summarized principles of the pattern, and proposed the criteria to detect pattern violation in Objective-C code. An automated tool has been developed to detect MVVM violation and report violation locations in the code so that developers can revise the code to follow the pattern.

It is still not accepted by programmers as expected. Still maximum programmers are working with WPF and MVC. Now it’s time to work with MVVM. MVVM is advanced ASP.NET technology in which we discuss MVVM pattern and describes how to implement its fundamental characteristics. It is a part of smart web based programming. MVVM scenario is implemented using Prism Library. The MVVM pattern is a close variant of the Presentation Model pattern, optimized to leverage some of the core capabilities of WPF and Silverlight, such as data binding, data templates, commands, and behaviors. It is more reliable MVC (Model View Controller) with more advanced features that takes advantage of particular strengths of the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) architecture to separate the Model and the View by introducing an abstract layer between them a “Model of the View,” or ViewModel. In this paper we will discuss brief introduction, features, data binding, and programming of MVVM. Introduction MVVM Foundation is a library of classes that are very useful when building applications based on the ModelView-ViewModel philosophy. The library is small and concentrated on providing only the most indispensable tools needed by most MVVM application developers. ModelView-ViewModel is a way of creating client applications that leverages core features of the WPF platform, allows for simple unit testing of application functionality, and helps developers and designers work together with less technical difficulties. The classes in the MVVM Foundation are timetested tools in the toolbox of many WPF developers around the world. Now they all live in one convenient project. MvvmFoundation. The source code download also contains a set of unit tests and a demo application, which show how to use the classes. WPF lends itself toward MVVM which increase testability, flexibility and maintainability. The Model-View-ViewModel pattern helps us to cleanly separate the business and presentation logic of our application from its user interface (UI). Maintaining a clean separation between application logic and UI helps to address numerous development and design issues and can make our application much easier to test, maintain, and evolve. It can also greatly improve code re-use opportunities and allows developers and UI designers to more easily collaborate when developing their respective parts of the application. Using the MVVM pattern, the UI of the application and the underlying presentation and business logic is separated into three separate classes: the view, which encapsulates the UI and UI logic; the view model, which encapsulates presentation logic and state; and the model, which encapsulates the application's business logic and data. Prism includes samples and reference implementations that show how to implement the MVVM pattern in a Silverlight or Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application. The Prism Library also provides features that can help we implement the pattern in were own applications. These features embody the most common practices for implementing the MVVM pattern and are designed to support testability and to work well with Expression Blend and Visual Studio. The pattern was first introduced by John Gossman – the architect on the Blend/WPF/Silverlight team – and derives from the Smalltalk ApplicationModel pattern, as does the PresentationModel pattern described by Martin Fowler. It was first utilized by the Expression team (John was part of that team at the time) as they developed version 1 of Expression Blend.

Such frameworks enable efficient incremental updates on the application’s state and visual layer, but they usually enforce the extended use of imperative logic in order to accomplish this effect. As an application is extended with additional functionality, the development process soon becomes extremely arduous and error-prone. This has lead to the emergence of Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and Web Component libraries that achieve higher developer productivity by keeping the required source code minimal and well-organized. Such frameworks can also provide additional mechanisms that automatically maintain the application state and the respective visual layer in sync, thus alleviating the application developer from this task. On the downside such mechanisms can negatively impact the performance of a given application and cause noticeable irregularities to the user experience. This research exam surveys MVVM and Web Component libraries that constitute the state-of-the-art in the web community. It also provides accurate definitions of the modules that compose an MVVM and a Component library and contains detailed description of the internal workings of each individual framework. Furthermore, this survey focuses on the mechanisms that are employed by MVVM and Component libraries to propagate changes from the application state to the respective part of the visual layer and describes the advantages and disadvantages of each individual mechanism. Lastly, we introduce FORWARD and its respective mechanisms that accomplish change propagation in an asymptotically more efficient manner than the respective mechanisms employed by competing frameworks.","",""

However, Android currently has no defined design pattern which causes a bit of a problem during the initial stages of development because the developer has to make that decision before the initial development starts. This sometimes causes excessive complexity in the finished application, which then becomes difficult to test and manage.In this report we compare the two design patterns Passive Model View Controller (PMVC) and Model View View-Model (MVVM) to decide which one is the least complex. For this we used so called metrics to show the complexity of the finished applications. The metrics were calculated using the existing library of functions called Cyclomatic Complexity Numbers (CCN). The study is based on the workflow Design & creation and aim to contribute with: knowledge that will make it easier to choose design pattern when developing an Android application, and if you can with CCN point out which areas in an application will take more or less time to conduct tests on.During the study we also analyzed how big of an impact the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) had on the complexity. This was part of the study so that we could see the difference of separated views versus non-separated views.The study shows us that the complexity in small applications is very similar, no matter which design pattern you're using. However, it also shows that there are certain parts of the applications that are diverse in their complexity and that code complexity on method-level can give directions to test cases.","",""

In this machine end-to-end component design is highly automated using computer-aided design (CAD) and computeraided manufacturing (CAM) programs. In other cases, a number of different machines are used with an external controller and human or robotic operators that move the component from machine to machine. In either case, the complex series of steps needed to produce any part is highly automated and produces a part that closely matches the original CAD design. While the specific intention and application for CNC machines vary from one machine type to another, all forms of CNC have common benefits. The first benefit offered by all forms of CNC machine tools is improved automation. The operator intervention related to producing work pieces can be reduced or eliminated. Many CNC machines can run unattended during their entire machining cycle, freeing the operator to do other tasks. This gives the CNC user several side benefits including reduced operator fatigue, fewer mistakes caused by human error, and consistent and predictable machining time for each work piece. Since the machine will be running under program control, the skill level required of the CNC operator (related to basic machining practice) is also reduced as compared to a machinist producing work pieces with conventional machine tools. Here we are presenting a control for gear testing CNC machine where operator of CNC gear testing machine can provide information about which teeth to be inspected during testing with operator friendly GUI using WPF and MVVM.

These kinds of applications require a loosely coupled modular architecture that allows individual parts of the application to be independently developed and tested, allowing the application to be modified or extended later on. Additionally, the architecture should promote testability, code re-use, and flexibility. Prism helps you to design and build flexible and maintainable WPF and Silverlight applications by using design patterns that support important architectural design principles, such as separation of concerns and loose coupling. This guide helps you understand these design patterns and describes how you can use Prism to implement them in your WPF or Silverlight applications.

In addition, the trend of miniaturization has allowed the development of new portable equipment, increasing the possibilities of point‐of‐use analysis at low cost. In this context, the objective of this study was to develop a portable analytical methodology using a low‐cost DLP NIRscan Nano spectrophotometer (Texas Instruments®) connected to a smartphone for data storage. For this, an app called NanoMetrix was developed, created natively for Android from Android Studio IDE, according to a software design standard known as Model‐View‐ViewModel (MVVM). To demonstrate the applicability of the method, 36 samples of plant tissue were analyzed to determine total nitrogen content. The calibration models were compared to those obtained with the SOLO+MIA software (Eigenvector Research, Inc.), 8.6.1. The results presented root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) 1.90 and 1.82 g kg−1, root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) 2.00 and 1.97 g kg−1, and R2pred 0.973 and 0.975, for the NanoMetrix application and the SOLO+MIA software, respectively. Therefore, the results indicate that the NanoMetrix integrated with the portable spectrophotometer, besides the acquisition of spectra, allows the processing of data in the field and reducing the time for the analysis and obtaining the results.

Android development comes with its own design practices and templates (layouts, activities, etc.). Developers also use different established architectural patterns for designing interactive software such as MVC, MVP and MVVM. They implement these patterns based on their understanding and experience. Thus, the choice and the implementation of such patterns varies from a developer to another. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that provides a comprehensive view of the use of these patterns in mobile apps. Moreover, there is no clear understanding of which pattern to use and what is the trend for designing mobile apps using such patterns. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to identify which MVC-based architectural pattern (MVC, MVP and MVVM) is used predominantly in a given app. For this purpose, we defined each of these patterns through a number of heuristics according to the pattern's potential implementations within the Android framework. We conducted an empirical study on a large set of mobile apps downloaded from the Google Play Store. We found, not surprisingly, a dominance of the popular MVC pattern, a rare use of MVP while MVVM is almost unused and a significant number of apps do not follow any pattern. The empirical study also enabled us to analyse the use of these patterns by domain, size and last-update date of the apps. We observed that MVC has been the most used pattern over the past years and it continues to gain popularity, and that small-size apps are mostly the ones that do not use any pattern.","",""

MVVM frameworks have attempted to simplify this process, by offering atemplate language that enables the declarative specification of dashboards, and by automaticallymaintaining the displayed visualizations when the visualized data change. These frameworks,however, still exhibit significant drawbacks. When mutations occur in underlying data sources,developers have to observe and manually propagate (using imperative code) said mutations tothe framework, which still requires advanced skill-set and experience in web development. Additionally, even though these frameworks automatically mutate the dependent visualizations (thusabsolving developers from manually performing this task), once mutations have been propagatedto the framework, their incremental rendering algorithms incur significant performance penalties,especially when visualizing big data.To address these issues, we present FORWARD, a framework that simplifies the development of custom live dashboards. FORWARD offers a declarative template languagethat simplifies the integration of (a) database and web service systems (such as Postgres andGraphQL), (b) visualization libraries (such as Google Maps and HighCharts), and (c) dataprocessing functions (performing aggregations, ML computations, and more), thus enabling atruly declarative specification of dashboards. This significantly lowers the technical expertiseneeded for dashboard development, thus allowing programmers with limited experience in webdevelopment (such as data analysts), to produce custom, information-dense, highly-reactivedashboards. FORWARD templates describe dashboards as semi-structured views. As a result,when mutations occur in the base-data of such views, FORWARD employs novel incrementalview maintenance techniques, that automatically propagate changes from data sources all theway to the visual layer more efficiently than existing frameworks.In this Thesis, we illustrate FORWARD’s template language and incremental renderingalgorithms, and show their superior algorithmic complexity compared to the state of the art.Experimental results validate the complexity results and show that FORWARD’s incrementalrendering can be orders of magnitude more efficient than existing approaches. Line-of-code anddevelopment time experiments show that the performance gains are accompanied by productivitygains for developers that use FORWARD to build information-dense dashboards. Lastly, wepresent ViDeTTe, a system that integrates FORWARD with Jupyter notebooks, and enables dataanalysts to build Jupyter Notebooks with reactive visualizations. Notebook readers can thendirectly interact with these visualizations to further explore the underlying data, a functionalitythat is currently not supported in Jupyter Notebooks.","",""

Moreover, this complexity is a major obstacle for achieving traceability across PL which is especially important for product verification. In order to support systems engineering by establishing traceability across PL and aid verification planning we propose Multi-View Variability Model (MVVM). MVVM introduces a set of variability models that represent variability in various development artifacts, e.g. architecture, requirements etc. and corresponding inter-model constraints. We provide a formalization of MVVM and perform a transformation of the MVVM model to a Constraint Satisfiability Problem (CSP) where we formulate queries for the CSP model in order to extract information about variability dependencies among MVVM views.

Such frameworks, typically, provide algorithms that automate the maintenance of the application’s view when mutations occur to the underlying data (also known as model). The automation of this process, commonly referred to as Application View Maintenance (AVM), significantly improves developer productivity, since it alleviates the developer from manually performing this task. Such algorithms are also capable of mutating individual parts of the view when the underlying data mutate, thus avoiding a full reload and rerendering of the entire application view, (a very expensive operation for HTML content, especially in the mobile setting). However, as we show in this work, AVM algorithms of existing MVVM frameworks are still suboptimal performance-wise. By continuously exploring the model for mutations, they have a complexity that is proportional to the size of the model and not to the size of mutations. This suboptimality combined with the low computational power of mobile devices, can lead to severely inefficient mobile apps, which can also impact the user experience. To address this issue, we propose a novel AVM algorithm which uses existing incremental view maintenance techniques, to directly identify the mutated parts of the model and infer the respective parts of the view that need to be updated, while avoiding a blowup in complexity proportional to the size of the model of the application. The complexity and memory consumption of the proposed algorithm are shown to be typically significantly lower than existing approaches.","",""

METHODS ACE is developed with C# using Microsoft .Net framework and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for elegant GUI design and smooth GUI transition animations through the integration of graphics engines and high dots per inch (DPI) settings on modern high resolution monitors. The industrial standard software design pattern, Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, is chosen to be the major architecture of ACE for neat coding structure, deep modularization, easy maintainability and seamless communication with other clinical software. ACE consists of 1) a patient data importing module integrated with clinical patient database server, 2) a 2D DICOM image and RT structure simultaneously displaying module, 3) a 3D RT structure visualization module using Visualization Toolkit or VTK library and 4) a contour evaluation module using supervised pattern recognition algorithms to detect contouring errors and display detection results. ACE relies on supervised learning algorithms to handle all image processing and data processing jobs. Implementations of related algorithms are powered by Accord.Net scientific computing library for better efficiency and effectiveness.   RESULTS ACE can take patient's CT images and RT structures from commercial treatment planning software via direct user input or from patients' database. All functionalities including 2D and 3D image visualization and RT contours error detection have been demonstrated with real clinical patient cases.   CONCLUSION ACE implements supervised learning algorithms and combines image processing and graphical visualization modules for RT contours verification. ACE has great potential for automated radiotherapy contouring quality verification. Structured with MVVM pattern, it is highly maintainable and extensible, and support smooth connections with other clinical software tools.","",""

The framework, called the Sensor Plot Kit (SPK), aims to help developers build apps for viewing sensor data that can be streamed in real-time or pre-recorded. It can handle multiple streams at relatively high data rates with short latencies, making it suitable for advanced medical applications such as electrocardiograms (ECG). This framework also supports filtering, post processing, and saving the data in non-volatile storage. A novel feature of our design is that we adopt the Model View View-Model (MVVM) design pattern that reduces complexity and maximizes code reusability compared to the standard Model View Controller (MVC) pattern in iOS while remaining compatible. Experimental results using a real-world ECG, on-board sensors, and pre-recorded results over actual and simulated iOS devices confirm that SPK enables developers to build feature-rich, robust apps that embed real-time, responsive plotting capability while significantly shortening development time. This work has the potential to make a crosscutting impact on science, engineering, medicine, the financial market, and many other fields that increasingly rely on smart phones and tablets as the primary device for viewing and interacting live and historical streams of data.","",""

Firstly, the WPF and the MVVM pattern decouple the User Interface (UI) presentation and business logic. Secondly, the component technology is used to decouple the business logic and Numerical Control(NC) functions. Thirdly, the implementation of NC tasks is put into non-RT environment and RT environment. The experiment results of developing the application based on the architecture show that the layered software architecture improves the maintenance and development efficiency, and running the application in the “non-RT+RT” environment proves that the architecture is available for PC-based master-slave CNC systems and soft-CNC systems.","",""

NetSafe uses a model-based anomaly detection approach that can be used with any type of sensor. The contaminant source identification leverages the Contaminant Status Algorithm (CSA), and the contaminant spread is determined using the EPANET MSX engine. NetSafe has been developed as .NET application written in C#. It is based on a robust design pattern called “Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)” that permits scalability as well as flexibility. The user interface can be completely defined using an XML like syntax called the eXtensible Application Markup Language (XAML). NetSafe has the ability to connect to relational databases to obtain SCADA data, and it has been tested with both Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and Microsoft Access 2003. The results displayed by NetSafe were independently verified using an Excel-based workbench. The architecture evolved through the creation of use case diagram, class diagram, communication diagram, sequence diagram, state activity diagram.

Analysis of scientific achievements using bibliographic information has become a significant part of scientific and technical management in many countries around the world, but unlike Slovenia and Poland, Ukraine does not have a single bibliographic database and relevant search interfaces. Therefore, the aim of the work is to develop an automated bibliographic system that will simplify the process of creating, editing, searching, sorting, statistics, deleting bibliographic information of research and teaching staff and will automate the formation of personalized reports. To implement the proposed automated system, a review of existing databases of bibliographic information and search interfaces was conducted.

However, some applications built on android tend to have a cumbersome interface causing inconveniences to users. This can be reduced by eliminating the redundancies during the build of these applications. List view is commonly used in android applications to arrange a list of scrollable items in a sequential order. This consumes a considerable amount of memory and CPU utilization resulting in the degradation of the applications. One proposed solution to this can be the introduction of the RecyclerView. The RecyclerView traditionally replaces the GridView and the ListView which were previously used in android applications. This improvement is achieved by recycling the views which are out of the visibility of the user inturn enhancing both the ListView as well as the GridView. Networking in android was previously a nightmare for developers where they had to retrieve and analyze their own data. Data transfer is performed in Android applications using a Web REST API. Development speed can be enhanced by efficient data analysis by utilizing a library from the entire range of REST client libraries. REST (Representational State Transfer) has become the most commonly used way for creating, publishing, and consuming Web services, exploiting JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as a data exchange format. The most used libraries for accessing the REST Web APIs today are Android Volley and Retrofit. An android device is hindered by limited power, memory and resources.

Today, software for managing bibliographic records is in demand in various countries in Europe and America. The most popular software in these countries is EndNote, RefWorks, BibTeX and Zotero. The development of such automated bibliographic system and the adaptation of its functionality to standards and requirements within Ukraine is relevant for a number of reasons. The main reasons are the need for every scientist and lecturer of higher education institutions to confirm their scientific achievements when hiring, submitting scientific work to various competitions, to obtain a scientific degree and so on. Today the rapid development of information and computer technology allows us to abandon the list of scientific papers in manual mode and move to the use of specialized software on smartphones.

The existing work can access multi-source heterogeneous sensor devices and display the sensing data of different devices on different visual interfaces. However, the information displayed by the system lacks relevance, and it is difficult to clarify the relationship between different sensor data, and it is impossible to display comprehensive information after merging multi-sensor data. Moreover, there is few work that meet the needs of query and playback of historical data. This paper designs and implements a real-time and historical multi-view IoT trend system to deal with the mentioned problems. Using the target information graph, it displays the relationship between different sensor data, and using the method combined real time and history, it proposes a buffered batch data loading algorithm to form a dual-display mode system. An IoT trend simulation platform based on B/S-MVC-MVVM architecture was built. Based on this platform, multi-source heterogeneous sensor data is accessed.

For example, there are currently the KnockoutJS, BackboneJS and ReactJS frameworks competing together with the different (entirely different) versions of ‘Angular’ frameworks. While some of these new frameworks are more popular than others, some are specialised in certain types of applications, and others have spe-cific advanced features or outstanding capabilities that set them above others. Moreover, with the increase usage and demand of mobile applications, the need for cross-platform frameworks has significantly increased as well. In this paper, we discuss the different criteria which identifies the strengths and weaknesses of using each framework in developing mobile and web-applications. We highlight and discuss 12 different features of latest application frameworks as ‘points of comparison’. Then we compare 5 of the trending frameworks (KnockoutJS, BackboneJS, AngularJS, React and Angular2) in a thorough analysis based on our earlier defined points of comparisons i.e. features. Finally, we focus more deeply on the newly released Angular2 framework showing the eminent capabilities and values added over different trending frameworks and over its own earlier versions. Overall, our comparative analysis results in a few interesting findings regarding different current frameworks, leaving us to believe that a new generation might soon emerge from the exponential path of MVC, MV*/MVW and MVVM.","",""

Several frameworks have been proposed to simplify the development of cross-platform mobile applications and, therefore, to reduce development and maintenance costs. Between them, cross-compiler mobile development frameworks, such as Xamarin from Microsoft, transform the application's code written in intermediate (aka non-native) language to native code for each target platform (Android, iOS). However, to our best knowledge, there is not much research about the advantages and disadvantages of the use of those frameworks during the development and maintenance phases of mobile applications. The objective of this paper is to present two datasets of questions and answers (Q&A) related to the development of mobile applications using Xamarin. Our datasets have 85,908 questions mined from the Xamarin Forum and 44,434 from Stack Overflow. To show their usefulness, we present two experiments. First, we replicate a study for discovering the main discussion topics of Xamarin development present in the two datasets using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and we compare them with topics previously reported about mobile development. Between the main topics discovered from those questions, we found that some of them are exclusively related to Xamarin and Microsoft technologies such as the design pattern 'MVVM'. Secondly, we aim at improving the official Xamarin documentation, which does not provide a complete description of the error codes that the Xamarin platform throws during development. We use our datasets of Q&A for complementing the error codes with information mined from accepted answers. We could complement the documentation of 23,9% of the error codes.","",""

The goal of the thesis is to use the form finding method dynamic relaxation to create a software application, which helps the layout engineers to automatically check whether an equipment transport route on offshore platforms is feasible using dynamic relaxation. This could potentially save a lot of time and add value by enabling the ability to run several iterations of the transport route with little effort. The thesis presents a new workflow, based on using the new application, and discusses advantages and disadvantages between the new and current workflow for transport route verification. By using Autodesk Navisworks and its .NET and COM API, a plug-in application was created for Navisworks, to automatically verify movement of an object through a given access way. This was done using Navisworks clash detective feature through the .NET API. The plug-in application required input parameter such as a validation object, a boundary geometry and a path. The plug-in application is divided into two phases; one path optimizing phase, and one verification phase. The optimizing phase is a pre-phase for the verification phase, to optimize run-time speed. The verification phase uses dynamic relaxation to try to move the validation object through the given path. If the validation object clashes with the boundary geometry, the dynamic relaxation will try to find a point of equilibrium where there is no clash. The plug-in application uses WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) as a presentation system in .NET, with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The visualization of the validation object’s movement, and the verification result, is done via Navisworks .NET API, where the movement is presented in Navisworks’ own UI. The plug-in application’s UI will present information about the status of a verification. The UI gives the opportunity for the user to monitor the velocity, acceleration and applied force in the dynamic relaxation method during verification using chart controls.","",""

In the Skoghall paperboard Mill operators make use of a range of different test methods. Since the work pace is high and the product is being continuously tested improvements of the workflow at the laboratory are always of interest. The aim of this project is to develop a program that connects test instruments at Skoghall Mill’s test laboratory to the Mill’s network. The motivation is to automate part of the work process by removing the step of manually reading measurement values from the test instruments. The scope of this project includes developing software that connects one of the instruments (the Short Span Compression tester [1] or SCT) at the laboratory to the Mill’s network. This program, named TestLink, will work as a proof of concept for connecting instruments using a common interface. The software is constructed using a modular approach forming a platform where an additional instrument can be connected by creating a new module. The software is developed in Visual Studio using C# as the programming language.

Durch die ansteigende Komplexitat sind neue Konzepte fur die Hilfestellung und Beratung erforderlich, welche sowohl der breiten Masse von Empfangsgeraten als auch den Sicherheitsstandards einer E-Banking Losung gerecht werden. Das Co-Browsing ermoglicht es dem Kundenberater, entweder seine eigene Anzeige dem Kunden freizugeben, oder die Anzeige seines Kunden zu ubernehmen. Dabei wird nicht wie bei herkommlichen Fernwartungs-Losungen der Zugriff auf das gesamte System gewahrt, sondern nur auf die aktuelle Anzeige innerhalb des Webbrowsers. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurde vorerst eine Evaluation bestehender Co-Browsing Losungen durchgefuhrt, welche ergab, dass der Stand der heutigen Technologien fur einen Einsatz in einer produktiven E-Banking Umgebung noch nicht genugend ausgereift ist. Aus diesem Grund wurde die Losung als Prototyp in einer simulierten E-Banking Plattform implementiert. Zwischen den Browsern (Kunde/Berater) wird eine Verbindung uber WebSockets hergestellt und mittels Nachrichten Informationen ubertragen. Um auf Anderungen der Anzeige (z.B. Seitenwechsel) zu reagieren, wird das Document Object Model (DOM) uberwacht und bei Mutationen werden Events ausgelost, um die Gegenstelle abzugleichen. Die Serverseite (WebSockets) wurde in JavaScript (Node.js) implementiert. Der Server stellt zum einen die Kommunikation zwischen Kunde und Berater uber Channels sicher und beinhaltet zum anderen eine Datenstruktur fur das Persistieren der Informationen. Um auf der Clientseite eine grossere Web-Applikation simulieren zu konnen (z.B. clientseitiges Routing, Login) wurde das JavaScript Framework AngularJS verwendet. Dies erlaubt es, die Applikation sinnvoll zu strukturieren und auch im JavaScript Umfeld Paradigmen wie MVC/MVVM und Dependency Injection einzusetzen.

Hinter Xamarin steht das Mono Framework, eine Open Source Implementierung des Microsofts .NET Framework, welches im Jahr 2001 erstmals veroffentlicht wurde. Der Vorteil von Xamarin ist, dass native Applikationen fur alle drei fuhrenden mobilen Plattformen mit der gleichen Programmiersprache C# entwickelt werden konnen. Xamarin hat die Schnittstelle von Android und iOS mit regularen C# Klassen gekapselt. Entwickler profitieren von der modernen Programmiersprache C# und deren Funktionalitaten wie LINQ, funktionalen Lambda Ausdrucken und Generics. Im Gegensatz zu Web Apps wird das User Interface pro Plattform separat programmiert. Dadurch wird das gewunschte Benutzererlebnis erreicht und es konnen auch leistungskritische Anwendungen wie Spiele programmiert werden. Als primares Ziel gilt das gemeinsame Nutzen von Code. Mit Hilfe von portablen Klassenbibliotheken ist es moglich, den gleichen Code fur alle drei Plattformen zu nutzen. Eine saubere Trennung zwischen dem User Interface und dem Business Layer ist erstrebenswert. Um dies zu erreichen, muss das Model-View-ViewModel Muster (MVVM) plattformubergreifend genutzt werden konnen. Das Framework MvvmCross stellt hierfur einige Bibliotheken zur Verfugung. Nachdem die Grundlagen von Xamarin und MvvmCross bekannt waren, stand die Portierung der bestehenden Windows Phone App „MeteoCheck.ch“ auf Android und iOS im Vordergrund. Die Applikation bietet nebst den aktuellen Wetterprognosen auch zusatzlich Informationen wie zum Beispiel Lawineninformationen, Sonnenstand und Live Kamera Bilder. Nach einer grundlichen Analyse wurde das vorhandene Projekt in eine portable Klassenbibliothek und in ein Windows Phone Projekt aufgeteilt. Die portable Klassenbibliothek enthalt alle ViewModels und ist fur die Kommunikation mit dem Web Server zustandig. MvvmCross hat zudem einen IoC Container und ein Navigation Controller implementiert, wodurch die Navigation der einzelnen Ansichten uber die ViewModels gesteuert werden kann. Die grosste Schwierigkeit bestand fortan bei der Entwicklung der einzelnen User Interfaces. Bei der Android Entwicklung war dies vergleichsweise einfach, da Java Implementierungen fast identisch mit C# abgebildet werden konnten. Bei iOS Applikationen mit der nativen Programmiersprache Objectiv-C, war dies durch den gesetzten zeitlichen Rahmen schwieriger, was fur den weiteren Verlauf bedeutete, dass der Android Prototyp erweitert wurde. Abschliessend kann gesagt werden, dass mit Xamarin gute Applikationen entwickelt werden konnen, sofern die notwendigen Kenntnisse uber die Architektur und den Lebenszyklus der jeweiligen Plattformen vorhanden sind.","",""

This dissertation provide an overview on the planning and implementation of a graphical modeling tool of document flows to serve an existing platform to manage them. The document flow can be described as a document oriented process in opposition to business processes, BPM, which are oriented to business work routines. The first analysis of the problem was to understand the components that in which all the flow logic is divided. There are a set of elements, that define the flow design. In that set of elements there is a particular one, the operation, that can be associated to services/plug-ins, responsible to provide a certain automatism. In the second analysis was concluded that the set of elements is quite simple. The core of this platform is the the logic flexibility provided by the services associated to the automatic operations. The main goal of this project was to find a way to balance between the simplicity of the flow architecture logic with the perspective of this logic suffers a evolution, taking into account the users profiles and the maintainability. Although the standards chosen, BPMN (Business Process Modeling) and XPDL (XML Process Definition Language), provide the necessary means so that the flow can be defined and at the same time save some elements to cover the emergence of new components in the flow design, it was also necessary to take into account the case of this notation became unuseful for this platform. As a consequence, this solution was implemented under an layer architecture named MVVM (Model View View-Model), which abstracts the user interface and data model. The goals of this work were completed successfully, since it was built a solution using standard formats that ensures the necessary basis to define a flow under the rules that this platform demands. The definition of the flow was divided into modules that separate the draw logic and services logic, facilitating the maintenance and definition of each one of these components.","",""
