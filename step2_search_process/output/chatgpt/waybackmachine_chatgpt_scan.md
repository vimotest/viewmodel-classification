You shall be a scientific expert in GUI architectural patterns. The target audience are software engineering researchers in context of software architecture.

For my SLR, I want to find out if websites dealing with the MVVM pattern provide the standard definition or a deviation to it.

I provide you the detailed standard definition:

* MVVM is a variation of MVC
* View is the responsibility of a designer rather than a classic developer
* Design is almost always done in a declarative form like HTML or XAML
* MVVM relies on a general mechanism for data binding
* Model is defined as in MVC: data or business logic (completely UI independent)
* View consists of visual elements (buttons, graphics, complex controls)
* View encodes control interactions with input devices like the Controller of MVC
* Simple example: view is data bound directly to the model
    * mix of two-way and one-way binding possible
    * example: boolean of model to CheckBox, string to a TextBox
* In practice: Model cannot be mapped directly to controls
    * view state like "edit/view"-mode or selection
* ViewModel: "Model of a View"
    * abstraction of the view
    * provides a specialization of the model for data-binding
    * contains data-transformers for conversion
    * contains commands for interactions
* Based on an example:
    * Selection is one of the most common components of a ViewModel
    * ViewModel might provide properties for gradient stop of brushes, converters for mapping colors to text values
    * View might changed to something radically different, ViewModel might provide abstract representation for reusable parts of a UI
* "ViewModel" is the suffix of a View's ViewModel's class
* MVVM to be a specialization of the more general PresentationModel pattern by Martin Fowler
* ViewModel does not need a reference to a view
* View never performs modifications to the model data
* View has no idea that the model classes exist
* ViewModel and model are unaware of the view
* Model is unaware of the ViewModel and view
* Through data-binding you get loose coupling between the view and the ViewModel
* A view is just an arbitrary consumer of a ViewModel
* Most ViewModel classes need the same features
    * often there is a need for a ViewModel base class
* MVVM is a set of guidelines, not rules
* The design of model classes has almost nothing to do with the MVVM pattern
* ViewModel might have additional validation logic
* Codebehind (part of view) shall only contain code that manipulates the controls and resources contained within that view
* View defines structure, layout, and appearance of what the user sees on screen (encapsulates UI Logic)
* ViewModel provides properties and commands that define the functionality to be offered by the UI (encapsulates Presentation Logic and State)
* Model represents the app's domain model, which usually includes a data model, business and validation logic (encapsulates Business Logic and Data)
* Tip: Keep the UI responsive with asynchronous operations.
* There is typically a one-to-many relationship between the ViewModel and the model classes
* ViewModel provides data from a model in a form that the view can easily consume
* Tip: Centralize data conversions in a conversion layer.
* View and ViewModel construction and runtime-association can be done in many approaches
    * View first composition
    * ViewModel first composition
* A common approach to instantiate a ViewModel in a view is to use a view model locator, means that the application has a single class that is responsible for connecting view models to views

Standard benefits:

* ViewModel is an abstraction of the View
* reduction of business logic or glue code stuck in code-behind
* ViewModel is easier to unit test
* ViewModel is more Model-ish, test it without awkward UI automation and interaction
* Data-binding performance is quite good
* development team can focus on creating robust ViewModel classes, and the design team can focus on making user-friendly Views
* MVVM enables a developer-designer workflow
* each MVVM component (Model, ViewModel, Model) is decoupled from each other, enabling: Components to be swapped, Internal implementation to be changed without affecting the others, Components to be worked on independently
* MVVM helps cleanly separate an application's business and presentation logic from UI
* makes the application easier to test, maintain, and evolve
* ViewModel acts as an adapter for the model classes and prevents from making major changes to the model code
* UI can be redesigned without touching the view model
* view model acts as an adapter for the model classes and enables you to avoid making any major changes to the model code

Standard disadvantages:

* simple UI, MVVM can be overkill
* bigger cases, it can be hard to design the ViewModel up front
* Data-binding is declarative and harder to debug
* Bindings might be heavier than the objects being bound, which can lead to more memory consumption

Carefully determine to which of the following categories each website belongs:
A: Standard Definition of MVVM
B: Deviation or Stricter Version of the Standard Definition
C: New Benefits/Drawbacks
D: No useful definition of MVVM found on the whole website
E: Undefined Category

If a website uses concrete tools or frameworks, mark the category with a '*' and notice the technology. E.g., a website stating the default definition of MVVM in context of WPF shall have the category A*. If it does not state a clear definition, but examples to a specific technology, it would be D*. There might also be combinations, e.g. if a website defines the standard definition and extended benefits, then it would be A/C. If a website defines a standard definition, and compatible extensions, it is A/B. If it has a definition which significantly deviates from standard, then it is only B.

Hints for detecting Deviations (Category B):

If a website:
- Mentions anything relevant about specific cardinalities between View/ViewModel, e.g., one-to-one mapping or one-to-many
- Discusses non-standard design variants or additional responsibilities.
- Discusses granularity of ViewModel properties (composite vs. flattened fields).
- Mentions reuse implications of View/ViewModel.
- Includes navigation logic, application lifecycle management, UI threading, or asynchronous presenter logic.

Hints what counts as New Benefits/Drawbacks (Category C):
Any benefits or drawbacks not mentioned in the standard definition.

No Useful Definition (Category D):

- If the website doesn't provide any meaningful information about MVVM or its components.
- If a website doesn't discuss the ViewModel component's design.

Technology Specific (Mark with '*'):
If a website discusses MVVM in the context of a specific tool or framework (e.g., WPF, Android, RxJava).

General Guidelines:
- Focus on framework-independent aspects.
- Focus on the ViewModel component design.
- Ignore business logic placement details.
- Code examples related to specific platforms/frameworks don't count as definition parts.
- Framework-specific standard MVVM usage counts as Standard Definition (Category A).
- Carefully regard all hints I gave you for determining categories. Try to avoid mixing categories if possible, combine categories only if it is not clear to distinguish.

Also determine the type of the website, e.g., personal blog article, company blog article, tutorial, forum, etc.

Loop over following website URLs and extract Website-Name, Category, Type, Deviation/Extension Aspects, New Benefits, New Drawbacks, Technology, View/ViewModel Cardinality, Reason (why you chose the category). Notice information concisely with bullet-points.

- Used WebPilot

The content from the JBS website focuses on comparing .NET MAUI with other frameworks like React Native and Flutter, and it discusses the evolution of Xamarin into .NET MAUI. However, it does not provide specific information about the MVVM pattern, its standard definition, deviations, benefits, or drawbacks. Here are the key points:

- **Comparison with Other Frameworks**: The article compares .NET MAUI with React Native and Flutter, highlighting differences in state management and UI generation.
- **Xamarin and .NET MAUI**: It discusses Xamarin's limitations in cross-platform support and how .NET MAUI improves upon it, offering better platform support and integration with .NET CLI.
- **Technology Focus**: The content is centered around .NET MAUI, React Native, and Flutter, but without specific reference to the MVVM pattern.

Based on this analysis, the website falls into Category D (No useful definition of MVVM found on the whole website) and is marked with a '*' due to its focus on specific technologies like .NET MAUI, React Native, and Flutter. The type of the website appears to be a company blog article.

Now, let's proceed to analyze the second website.

- Used WebPilot

The content from the TurboFuture website provides an overview of the MVVM pattern, particularly in the context of iOS development. Here are the key points:

- **MVVM in iOS**: The article explains MVVM as an improvement to MVC, particularly for iOS applications. It describes the roles of the View, Model, and ViewModel, emphasizing the separation of concerns and the benefits of this architecture in iOS development.
- **Example Application**: A temperature app example is used to illustrate the MVVM pattern. The article explains how the ViewModel interacts with the View and Model, highlighting the ViewModel's role in managing UI state and data transformations.
- **Comparison with MVC**: The article discusses how MVVM improves upon MVC by reducing the complexity and size of controllers, making the application easier to test and maintain.
- **Pros and Cons**: It lists the advantages of MVVM, such as weak coupling and better testability, and also mentions some drawbacks like increased complexity and development cost for simple applications.
- **Technology Specific**: The article is specific to iOS development, discussing MVVM in the context of iOS application architecture.

Based on this analysis, the website falls into Category A* (Standard Definition of MVVM with a focus on a specific technology) due to its accurate depiction of the MVVM pattern within the context of iOS development. The type of the website appears to be a tutorial or educational article.

Now, let's create the overview table summarizing the analysis of both websites:

| Website-Name | Category | Type | Deviation/Extension Aspects | New Benefits | New Drawbacks | Technology | View/ViewModel Cardinality | Reason |
|--------------|----------|------|-----------------------------|--------------|---------------|------------|---------------------------|--------|
| JBS Website  | D*       | Company Blog Article | N/A | N/A | N/A | .NET MAUI, React Native, Flutter | N/A | No MVVM definition, focus on specific technologies |
| TurboFuture  | A*       | Tutorial/Educational Article | N/A | N/A | N/A | iOS | N/A | Accurate depiction of MVVM in iOS context |

This table provides a concise summary of the analysis of the two websites regarding their treatment of the MVVM pattern.
