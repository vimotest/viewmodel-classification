However, the software still frequently unstructured developed without any pattern that can facilitate other developers to continue that software development, we called this approach as ""anti-pattern."" To overcome the anti-pattern problem and with the goal of improving maintainability, the developer begins to apply various architectural design patterns such as MVC, MVP, and MVVM to the development of Android-based mobile application. In this paper, we compare maintainability and modularity between 2 applications build with design pattern (MVP) and without design pattern or commonly referred as 'anti-pattern' using jHawk 6 as a software metrics tools. Use of jHawk 6 reduced subjectivity of measurements in some of the previous studies that make this research more proven with the use of selected maintainability and modularity metrics from previous qualified studies. In the end, this study proved empirically, use of MVP Design pattern significantly increase modularity by two times. With this results, we strongly recommend the use of the MVP design pattern in android based mobile application development.","",""

Web-based applications are becoming increasingly popular in replacing previous Windows-based applications. This has lead to a growth in new technologies and architectures to cope with the new workload and performance demands that web-based applications can require. This paper will look at a current software company that provides process-heavy web-based application systems providing grant management services to medical and academic research. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the performance of their existing Web Forms based management system against newly developed dynamic component-based architecture using a variant of the Model View Controller (MVC) and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) patterns, which we have termed MVDVM (Model-View-DynamicView Model). Accurate and meaningful results will demonstrate how applications can now benefit from this approach.","",""

Performance efficiency can be improved by applying architecture patterns. In this paper, we use the Model View ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. The application of the architecture is carried out to analyze how practical the application of the MVVM architecture pattern is in increasing performance efficiency in the mobile application. Performance efficiency is measured based on CPU usage, memory usage, and execution Time. The case study shows that the CPU usage and execution Time on MVVM are smaller than Base architecture pattern from the AR Ruler. This is due to the third-party library RxSwift in the MVVM architecture that increases the application's response so that CPU usage and execution time is better than Base architecture pattern. However, the existence of the third-party library RxSwift has a negative impact on memory usage, resulting in higher memory usage than the Base Architecture Pattern. The MVVM pattern is highly recommended for mobile application development to improve performance efficiency.","",""

It is still not accepted by programmers as expected. Still maximum programmers are working with WPF and MVC. Now it’s time to work with MVVM. MVVM is advanced ASP.NET technology in which we discuss MVVM pattern and describes how to implement its fundamental characteristics. It is a part of smart web based programming. MVVM scenario is implemented using Prism Library. The MVVM pattern is a close variant of the Presentation Model pattern, optimized to leverage some of the core capabilities of WPF and Silverlight, such as data binding, data templates, commands, and behaviors. It is more reliable MVC (Model View Controller) with more advanced features that takes advantage of particular strengths of the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) architecture to separate the Model and the View by introducing an abstract layer between them a “Model of the View,” or ViewModel. In this paper we will discuss brief introduction, features, data binding, and programming of MVVM. Introduction MVVM Foundation is a library of classes that are very useful when building applications based on the ModelView-ViewModel philosophy. The library is small and concentrated on providing only the most indispensable tools needed by most MVVM application developers. ModelView-ViewModel is a way of creating client applications that leverages core features of the WPF platform, allows for simple unit testing of application functionality, and helps developers and designers work together with less technical difficulties. The classes in the MVVM Foundation are timetested tools in the toolbox of many WPF developers around the world. Now they all live in one convenient project. MvvmFoundation. The source code download also contains a set of unit tests and a demo application, which show how to use the classes. WPF lends itself toward MVVM which increase testability, flexibility and maintainability. The Model-View-ViewModel pattern helps us to cleanly separate the business and presentation logic of our application from its user interface (UI). Maintaining a clean separation between application logic and UI helps to address numerous development and design issues and can make our application much easier to test, maintain, and evolve. It can also greatly improve code re-use opportunities and allows developers and UI designers to more easily collaborate when developing their respective parts of the application. Using the MVVM pattern, the UI of the application and the underlying presentation and business logic is separated into three separate classes: the view, which encapsulates the UI and UI logic; the view model, which encapsulates presentation logic and state; and the model, which encapsulates the application's business logic and data. Prism includes samples and reference implementations that show how to implement the MVVM pattern in a Silverlight or Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application. The Prism Library also provides features that can help we implement the pattern in were own applications. These features embody the most common practices for implementing the MVVM pattern and are designed to support testability and to work well with Expression Blend and Visual Studio. The pattern was first introduced by John Gossman – the architect on the Blend/WPF/Silverlight team – and derives from the Smalltalk ApplicationModel pattern, as does the PresentationModel pattern described by Martin Fowler. It was first utilized by the Expression team (John was part of that team at the time) as they developed version 1 of Expression Blend.

In Financial Industry, various applications require flexible GUI because market value of financial products continuously changes. This paper explains use of WPF and MVVM pattern in UI development of financial application.","",""

There are many ways to improve the services at the K1 clinic (Kawan Kewan). Pet Owners are worried when going to the vet clinic because they are uninformed of the incurred expenses that they will get  after having a medical examination at the clinic. Meanwhile the clinic needs a system that can manage administration and can increase the satisfaction of customers who come to the clinic, as well as manage all administration related to the veterinary service process. The primary goal of this research is to make an Android-based mobile application to simplify administration and give a better experience for every customer who come to the veterinary clinic. In this research, the waterfall method is used as a testing tool because this method allows for departmentalization and control. Therefore, this method is suitable for solving the existing cases at the K1 Veterinary Clinic (Kawan Kewan) by utilizing the MVVM architecture framework for Android application development. The application, which was created utilizing the MVVM design and the Kotlin programming language, was tested on users and produced pleasing results. It efficiently meets the needs of users and clinics, making pet services possible.","",""

Nowadays, the library has gradually become the place where students learn most in universities at home and abroad. Therefore, our team will design an interdisciplinary practice in the library of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The survey found that the libraries of Huazhong University of Science and Technology and other universities achieve self-service management through self-service machines, public numbers, official websites, and other channels, but students generally think that the function is cumbersome and inconvenient to query, so we want to design a book self-service management system to bring the greatest convenience to users. This practice uses literature analysis, questionnaires, interviews, and experiments to deeply understand the pain points of library self-service machines, the design principles of relevant interfaces of libraries at home and abroad, and the needs of users to determine the information construction, interactive experience and technical needs of the system. This project is mainly an interdisciplinary practice of computer science and industrial design. In terms of technology, the system uses Android and MVVM architecture to display the front-end interface, realizes the Android network request through OkHttp and Retrofit, and uses ZXing open-source scanning technology to realize the function of borrowing and returning books on the palm; Go language and Echo Web framework is used for development, and Docker is used to deploying containers. In terms of design, the system combines ergonomics, design psychology, and so on, which not only realizes the basic functions of mobile phones, such as scanning code, borrowing, and returning books, map guide, and searching books but also adds special functions such as lost and found, recording reading time and so on, so as to enhance the user's personalized experience. After the usability test, the interviewees believe that the design can greatly improve the learning efficiency in the library.","",""
