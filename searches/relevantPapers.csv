Android development comes with its own design practices and templates (layouts, activities, etc.). Developers also use different established architectural patterns for designing interactive software such as MVC, MVP and MVVM. They implement these patterns based on their understanding and experience. Thus, the choice and the implementation of such patterns varies from a developer to another. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that provides a comprehensive view of the use of these patterns in mobile apps. Moreover, there is no clear understanding of which pattern to use and what is the trend for designing mobile apps using such patterns. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to identify which MVC-based architectural pattern (MVC, MVP and MVVM) is used predominantly in a given app. For this purpose, we defined each of these patterns through a number of heuristics according to the pattern's potential implementations within the Android framework. We conducted an empirical study on a large set of mobile apps downloaded from the Google Play Store. We found, not surprisingly, a dominance of the popular MVC pattern, a rare use of MVP while MVVM is almost unused and a significant number of apps do not follow any pattern. The empirical study also enabled us to analyse the use of these patterns by domain, size and last-update date of the apps. We observed that MVC has been the most used pattern over the past years and it continues to gain popularity, and that small-size apps are mostly the ones that do not use any pattern.","",""

Several frameworks have been proposed to simplify the development of cross-platform mobile applications and, therefore, to reduce development and maintenance costs. Between them, cross-compiler mobile development frameworks, such as Xamarin from Microsoft, transform the application's code written in intermediate (aka non-native) language to native code for each target platform (Android, iOS). However, to our best knowledge, there is not much research about the advantages and disadvantages of the use of those frameworks during the development and maintenance phases of mobile applications. The objective of this paper is to present two datasets of questions and answers (Q&A) related to the development of mobile applications using Xamarin. Our datasets have 85,908 questions mined from the Xamarin Forum and 44,434 from Stack Overflow. To show their usefulness, we present two experiments. First, we replicate a study for discovering the main discussion topics of Xamarin development present in the two datasets using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and we compare them with topics previously reported about mobile development. Between the main topics discovered from those questions, we found that some of them are exclusively related to Xamarin and Microsoft technologies such as the design pattern 'MVVM'. Secondly, we aim at improving the official Xamarin documentation, which does not provide a complete description of the error codes that the Xamarin platform throws during development. We use our datasets of Q&A for complementing the error codes with information mined from accepted answers. We could complement the documentation of 23,9% of the error codes.","",""

Many architectural patterns used by developers such as Model View Controller (MVC), Model View Presenter (MVP), Model View ViewModel (MVVM), and View Interactor Presenter Entity Router (VIPER) have promised stability of the product. Nowadays, most developers tend to use MVC architectural pattern as this pattern is easy to use and separate the logic between model, view and controller. However, this architecture has common problems which are hard to test and manage the code because all the codes for business application are placed in controller components. Therefore, this paper reviewed some of the existing architectural patterns qualities specifically in testability, modifiability and performance quality in order to investigate the mentioned problems. By using Contact mobile apps as a case study, the results show the MVVM architecture is good for testability, modifiability (cohesion level procedural), and performance (memory consumption). In addition, VIPER is the best in modifiability (coupling level data and coupling level message) and performance of CPU.","",""

Use of jHawk 6 reduced subjectivity of measurements in some of the previous studies that make this research more proven with the use of selected maintainability and modularity metrics from previous qualified studies. In the end, this study proved empirically, use of MVP Design pattern significantly increase modularity by two times. With this results, we strongly recommend the use of the MVP design pattern in android based mobile application development.","",""

This pattern is composed of model, view and viewmodel, the problem of data swap between the model and the viewmodel is resolved by realizing INotifyPropertyChanged interface, and the model independent of the viewmodel is realized. In the while, the problem of event binding in view is resolved by realizing ICommand interface, combined with data binding, the viewmodel independent of the view is realized. Examples show that using the MVVM pattern to design the RIA system can realize the logical interface complete separate from the application logic and has a good capacity of automated testing.","",""

App developers thus have to consider and apply best practices and design recommendations such as architectural patterns. One of these patterns is the popular MVC (Model View Controller) and its variants: MVP (Model View Presenter) and MVVM (Model View ViewModel). However, there is no common or established strategy that developers can follow when implementing these patterns in their apps. In this context, analyzing existing mobile apps and identifying their implementations of the MVC pattern variants becomes important to understand the current practices in mobile apps. In this paper, we present a classification-based approach to identify MVC-based patterns in Android apps. We provide a dataset of 69 Android apps manually annotated with the applied MVC-based pattern. We validate our approach on 265 open-source Android apps and show that it outperforms the only existing pattern detection tool for all the MVC-based variants.","",""

Web-based applications are becoming increasingly popular in replacing previous Windows-based applications. This has lead to a growth in new technologies and architectures to cope with the new workload and performance demands that web-based applications can require. This paper will look at a current software company that provides process-heavy web-based application systems providing grant management services to medical and academic research. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the performance of their existing Web Forms based management system against newly developed dynamic component-based architecture using a variant of the Model View Controller (MVC) and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) patterns, which we have termed MVDVM (Model-View-DynamicView Model). Accurate and meaningful results will demonstrate how applications can now benefit from this approach.","",""

For example, there are currently the KnockoutJS, BackboneJS and ReactJS frameworks competing together with the different (entirely different) versions of ‘Angular’ frameworks. While some of these new frameworks are more popular than others, some are specialised in certain types of applications, and others have spe-cific advanced features or outstanding capabilities that set them above others. Moreover, with the increase usage and demand of mobile applications, the need for cross-platform frameworks has significantly increased as well. In this paper, we discuss the different criteria which identifies the strengths and weaknesses of using each framework in developing mobile and web-applications. We highlight and discuss 12 different features of latest application frameworks as ‘points of comparison’. Then we compare 5 of the trending frameworks (KnockoutJS, BackboneJS, AngularJS, React and Angular2) in a thorough analysis based on our earlier defined points of comparisons i.e. features. Finally, we focus more deeply on the newly released Angular2 framework showing the eminent capabilities and values added over different trending frameworks and over its own earlier versions. Overall, our comparative analysis results in a few interesting findings regarding different current frameworks, leaving us to believe that a new generation might soon emerge from the exponential path of MVC, MV*/MVW and MVVM.","",""

Performance efficiency can be improved by applying architecture patterns. In this paper, we use the Model View ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. The application of the architecture is carried out to analyze how practical the application of the MVVM architecture pattern is in increasing performance efficiency in the mobile application. Performance efficiency is measured based on CPU usage, memory usage, and execution Time. The case study shows that the CPU usage and execution Time on MVVM are smaller than Base architecture pattern from the AR Ruler. This is due to the third-party library RxSwift in the MVVM architecture that increases the application's response so that CPU usage and execution time is better than Base architecture pattern. However, the existence of the third-party library RxSwift has a negative impact on memory usage, resulting in higher memory usage than the Base Architecture Pattern. The MVVM pattern is highly recommended for mobile application development to improve performance efficiency.","",""

It is still not accepted by programmers as expected. Still maximum programmers are working with WPF and MVC. Now it’s time to work with MVVM. MVVM is advanced ASP.NET technology in which we discuss MVVM pattern and describes how to implement its fundamental characteristics. It is a part of smart web based programming. MVVM scenario is implemented using Prism Library. The MVVM pattern is a close variant of the Presentation Model pattern, optimized to leverage some of the core capabilities of WPF and Silverlight, such as data binding, data templates, commands, and behaviors. It is more reliable MVC (Model View Controller) with more advanced features that takes advantage of particular strengths of the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) architecture to separate the Model and the View by introducing an abstract layer between them a “Model of the View,” or ViewModel. In this paper we will discuss brief introduction, features, data binding, and programming of MVVM. Introduction MVVM Foundation is a library of classes that are very useful when building applications based on the ModelView-ViewModel philosophy. The library is small and concentrated on providing only the most indispensable tools needed by most MVVM application developers. ModelView-ViewModel is a way of creating client applications that leverages core features of the WPF platform, allows for simple unit testing of application functionality, and helps developers and designers work together with less technical difficulties. The classes in the MVVM Foundation are timetested tools in the toolbox of many WPF developers around the world. Now they all live in one convenient project. MvvmFoundation. The source code download also contains a set of unit tests and a demo application, which show how to use the classes. WPF lends itself toward MVVM which increase testability, flexibility and maintainability. The Model-View-ViewModel pattern helps us to cleanly separate the business and presentation logic of our application from its user interface (UI). Maintaining a clean separation between application logic and UI helps to address numerous development and design issues and can make our application much easier to test, maintain, and evolve. It can also greatly improve code re-use opportunities and allows developers and UI designers to more easily collaborate when developing their respective parts of the application. Using the MVVM pattern, the UI of the application and the underlying presentation and business logic is separated into three separate classes: the view, which encapsulates the UI and UI logic; the view model, which encapsulates presentation logic and state; and the model, which encapsulates the application's business logic and data. Prism includes samples and reference implementations that show how to implement the MVVM pattern in a Silverlight or Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application. The Prism Library also provides features that can help we implement the pattern in were own applications. These features embody the most common practices for implementing the MVVM pattern and are designed to support testability and to work well with Expression Blend and Visual Studio. The pattern was first introduced by John Gossman – the architect on the Blend/WPF/Silverlight team – and derives from the Smalltalk ApplicationModel pattern, as does the PresentationModel pattern described by Martin Fowler. It was first utilized by the Expression team (John was part of that team at the time) as they developed version 1 of Expression Blend.

The activities such applications do while running on such devices consume energy and drain the device's battery. Many of these applications use REST API to communicate with their backend services running outside of the devices, primarily on the cloud. The paradigms like Model View View-Model (MVVM) used on the application side require data transformations that cause applications to consume more battery. There is a need for an improved approach and a paradigm that can be used to develop green software with reduced battery consumption. This paper proposes a novel Remote-Model View Remote-View-Model (RMVRVM) paradigm. The use of RMVRVM paradigm lowers the battery consumption on devices where the application is running and hence contributes to writing green software. In addition, RMVRVM makes an application more responsive and thus a delight to use. This paradigm has been implemented in industrial case studies, and significant gains in terms of the reduced amount of data transfer, reduced battery consumption, and faster response time were observed.

This paper presents an ML-based approach for software architecture detection, namely, MVP (Model–View–Presenter) and MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel). Firstly, we present a labeled dataset that consists of 5973 data points retrieved from GitHub. Nine ML methods are applied for detection of software architecture from source code metrics. Using precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score, the outstanding ML model performance is 83%, 83%, 83%, and 83%, respectively. The ML model’s performance is validated using k-fold validation (k = 5).

MVVM frameworks have attempted to simplify this process, by offering atemplate language that enables the declarative specification of dashboards, and by automaticallymaintaining the displayed visualizations when the visualized data change. These frameworks,however, still exhibit significant drawbacks. When mutations occur in underlying data sources,developers have to observe and manually propagate (using imperative code) said mutations tothe framework, which still requires advanced skill-set and experience in web development. Additionally, even though these frameworks automatically mutate the dependent visualizations (thusabsolving developers from manually performing this task), once mutations have been propagatedto the framework, their incremental rendering algorithms incur significant performance penalties,especially when visualizing big data.To address these issues, we present FORWARD, a framework that simplifies the development of custom live dashboards. FORWARD offers a declarative template languagethat simplifies the integration of (a) database and web service systems (such as Postgres andGraphQL), (b) visualization libraries (such as Google Maps and HighCharts), and (c) dataprocessing functions (performing aggregations, ML computations, and more), thus enabling atruly declarative specification of dashboards. This significantly lowers the technical expertiseneeded for dashboard development, thus allowing programmers with limited experience in webdevelopment (such as data analysts), to produce custom, information-dense, highly-reactivedashboards. FORWARD templates describe dashboards as semi-structured views. As a result,when mutations occur in the base-data of such views, FORWARD employs novel incrementalview maintenance techniques, that automatically propagate changes from data sources all theway to the visual layer more efficiently than existing frameworks.In this Thesis, we illustrate FORWARD’s template language and incremental renderingalgorithms, and show their superior algorithmic complexity compared to the state of the art.Experimental results validate the complexity results and show that FORWARD’s incrementalrendering can be orders of magnitude more efficient than existing approaches. Line-of-code anddevelopment time experiments show that the performance gains are accompanied by productivitygains for developers that use FORWARD to build information-dense dashboards. Lastly, wepresent ViDeTTe, a system that integrates FORWARD with Jupyter notebooks, and enables dataanalysts to build Jupyter Notebooks with reactive visualizations. Notebook readers can thendirectly interact with these visualizations to further explore the underlying data, a functionalitythat is currently not supported in Jupyter Notebooks.","",""

Such frameworks, typically, provide algorithms that automate the maintenance of the application’s view when mutations occur to the underlying data (also known as model). The automation of this process, commonly referred to as Application View Maintenance (AVM), significantly improves developer productivity, since it alleviates the developer from manually performing this task. Such algorithms are also capable of mutating individual parts of the view when the underlying data mutate, thus avoiding a full reload and rerendering of the entire application view, (a very expensive operation for HTML content, especially in the mobile setting). However, as we show in this work, AVM algorithms of existing MVVM frameworks are still suboptimal performance-wise. By continuously exploring the model for mutations, they have a complexity that is proportional to the size of the model and not to the size of mutations. This suboptimality combined with the low computational power of mobile devices, can lead to severely inefficient mobile apps, which can also impact the user experience. To address this issue, we propose a novel AVM algorithm which uses existing incremental view maintenance techniques, to directly identify the mutated parts of the model and infer the respective parts of the view that need to be updated, while avoiding a blowup in complexity proportional to the size of the model of the application. The complexity and memory consumption of the proposed algorithm are shown to be typically significantly lower than existing approaches.","",""

However, some applications built on android tend to have a cumbersome interface causing inconveniences to users. This can be reduced by eliminating the redundancies during the build of these applications. List view is commonly used in android applications to arrange a list of scrollable items in a sequential order. This consumes a considerable amount of memory and CPU utilization resulting in the degradation of the applications. One proposed solution to this can be the introduction of the RecyclerView. The RecyclerView traditionally replaces the GridView and the ListView which were previously used in android applications. This improvement is achieved by recycling the views which are out of the visibility of the user inturn enhancing both the ListView as well as the GridView. Networking in android was previously a nightmare for developers where they had to retrieve and analyze their own data. Data transfer is performed in Android applications using a Web REST API. Development speed can be enhanced by efficient data analysis by utilizing a library from the entire range of REST client libraries. REST (Representational State Transfer) has become the most commonly used way for creating, publishing, and consuming Web services, exploiting JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as a data exchange format. The most used libraries for accessing the REST Web APIs today are Android Volley and Retrofit. An android device is hindered by limited power, memory and resources. Several architectures such as MVC(Model-View-Controller), MVP(Model-view-Presenter) and MVVM(ModelView-Viewmodel) are commonly used in the development of android applications.

One aspect of this role is to deliver tools based on those models to trading and sales staff, which they can use to quickly price proposed transactions and perform other analysis of market conditions. Historically these tools have been delivered as Excel spreadsheets.  WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) is a GUI framework which encourages architectural separation between the layout of the user interface itself (the ""View"") and the underlying interactions and calculations (the ""ViewModel"" and ""Model""). We have built a framework for developing tools in WPF that makes use of a graph-based calculation engine for implementing ViewModels and Models in F#. The engine is built on F# asynchronous workflows and provides a standard set of features to our tools. In this talk I'll discuss the implementation of this calculation engine, including various steps in its evolution that led up to our use of asynchronous workflows. I'll also talk about how well F# and asynchronous workflows have worked for us, and briefly discuss some of the challenges of integrating F# and WPF.","",""

Nowadays, the library has gradually become the place where students learn most in universities at home and abroad. Therefore, our team will design an interdisciplinary practice in the library of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The survey found that the libraries of Huazhong University of Science and Technology and other universities achieve self-service management through self-service machines, public numbers, official websites, and other channels, but students generally think that the function is cumbersome and inconvenient to query, so we want to design a book self-service management system to bring the greatest convenience to users. This practice uses literature analysis, questionnaires, interviews, and experiments to deeply understand the pain points of library self-service machines, the design principles of relevant interfaces of libraries at home and abroad, and the needs of users to determine the information construction, interactive experience and technical needs of the system. This project is mainly an interdisciplinary practice of computer science and industrial design. In terms of technology, the system uses Android and MVVM architecture to display the front-end interface, realizes the Android network request through OkHttp and Retrofit, and uses ZXing open-source scanning technology to realize the function of borrowing and returning books on the palm; Go language and Echo Web framework is used for development, and Docker is used to deploying containers. In terms of design, the system combines ergonomics, design psychology, and so on, which not only realizes the basic functions of mobile phones, such as scanning code, borrowing, and returning books, map guide, and searching books but also adds special functions such as lost and found, recording reading time and so on, so as to enhance the user's personalized experience. After the usability test, the interviewees believe that the design can greatly improve the learning efficiency in the library.","",""

A pivotal gauge of an application’s success rests on its practical utility in daily life, coupled with its demonstrated strong performance metrics. There are several performance metrics to evaluate the performance of an application, such as RAM usage, CPU utilization, and their impact on battery life. Additionally, it is crucial to consider the User Interface (UI) factor, which serves as the primary connection between users and applications. Beyond its role as a bridge between users and applications, the UI can also significantly affect the performance of an application, as rendering a UI often takes a considerable amount of time. Various approaches can be employed to enhance the rendering time of a UI, one of which involves the use of design patterns like Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), which effectively separate the business logic from the UI layer. This research study compares the performance of these two design patterns in the context of UI rendering time. The findings of this study confirm that MVVM outperforms MVC significantly in rendering UI components more rapidly. This superiority is attributed to MVVM’s inherent ability to isolate business logic, ultimately reducing rendering delays. Furthermore, MVVM’s prominent data binding feature further strengthens its efficiency in terms of UI rendering time.","",""

Many architectural patterns are available in present but there are few empirical data that support a specific choice; therefore, this paper makes a practical thorough analysis of three of the existing architectural patterns in order to prove which of them is better to be used in iOS mobile applications development. The three architectures compared in this study are Model-View-Controller (MVC), which is Apple's recommended architecture and is also the oldest and most widely used one; Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), which comes as a solution to the limitations of MVC; Model-View-Intent (MVI) which is used together with SwiftUI and a state machine, to achieve a reactive application considering current trends to this style of programming. Analysis of the resulting performance and testability was done by developing a case-study application in each of these three architectures. For assuring an objective comparison, performance benchmarks have been executed to monitor the memory and CPU. Aside from the performance, testability represents another key point which is analysed in the paper, by using the metrics represented by the amount of code required to implement testing the core functionalities of the application and test coverage. Finally, some conclusions that show which architectural pattern is most suitable for the iOS development were drawn.","",""

General architectures such as Clean Architecture may come to the rescue but leave room for interpretation as to how they work best on iOS and Android. This paper discusses using Hexagonal Architecture as the fundamental global architecture for mobile architectures, providing an extendable approach suitable for small and large projects and helping to achieve more independence from frameworks and external agencies and better testability.","",""
