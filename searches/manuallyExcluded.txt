The sheer number of different products that can be derived from PL points out to the scale of the challenge that Product Line Engineering (PLE) faces. Various development artifacts describe PL but due to their diversity, variability modeling across PL is a challenging task. Moreover, this complexity is a major obstacle for achieving traceability across PL which is especially important for product verification. In order to support systems engineering by establishing traceability across PL and aid verification planning we propose Multi-View Variability Model (MVVM). MVVM introduces a set of variability models that represent variability in various development artifacts, e.g. architecture, requirements etc. and corresponding inter-model constraints. We provide a formalization of MVVM and perform a transformation of the MVVM model to a Constraint Satisfiability Problem (CSP) where we formulate queries for the CSP model in order to extract information about variability dependencies among MVVM views. Throughout the paper we use a real system from the automotive domain as the working example in order to illustrate the introduced concepts.","",""

DUPLICATE 2,"Waseem Sheikh, Nadeem Sheikh","A Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Application Framework for Hearing Impairment Diagnosis - Type Dependency Architecture",2019,"","","","",25,"2023-02-26 08:28:03","","10.1109/IETC47856.2020.9249181","","",,,,,2,0.50,1,2,4,"Around 466 million people worldwide (over 5% of the world's population) have disabling hearing loss, and out of these 34 million are children. Estimates suggest that by 2050, over 900 million people worldwide will have disabling hearing loss. The annual global cost of unaddressed hearing loss amounts to US$ 750 billion. Early detection of hearing loss can reduce its impact on an individual's life in addition to saving a huge cost. This paper, the second in a series of three papers, presents the type dependency architecture of an open-source application framework for hearing impairment diagnosis. The framework is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern which separates the development of graphical user interface (GUI) from the development of business and back-end logic. Some of the benefits of the MVVM pattern include reusable components, independent development of GUI and business or back-end logic, flexibility to modify GUI without having to change business or back-end logic, ease of unit testing, and reduced maintenance overhead. The proposed framework along with the open-source code makes it possible to easily extend the application functionality thus enabling other researchers and practitioners to develop their own versions of hearing loss diagnosis applications. The proposed software was evaluated by an otolaryngologist and found to be very beneficial in assisting a clinician to reach a hearing impairment diagnosis conclusion more methodically, swiftly and accurately.","",""

MVVM separates the graphical interface and business processes, making it easier to develop and maintain applications. In an MVVM implementation, event and observer data are separated, observing calls from event listeners are avoided, and state is used for data. The MVVM architectural pattern can also reduce dependencies so that there is no close relationship between the view and the viewmodel. In addition, MVVM can also be used to manage the concentration of Android application development that functions as a public complaint. In this community complaint application it is intended that the public can notify their complaints without having to come to the location of the complaint. In addition, it can make it easier for the authorities to follow up on these complaints, so that the public government can provide better service and be responsive to complaints from the public.","",""

Estimates suggest that by 2050, over 900 million people worldwide will have disabling hearing loss. The annual global cost of unaddressed hearing loss amounts to US$ 750 billion. Early detection of hearing loss can reduce its impact on an individual's life in addition to saving a huge cost. This paper, the first in a series of three papers, presents the design and features of an open-source application framework for hearing impairment diagnosis. The framework is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern which separates the development of graphical user interface (GUI) from the development of business and back-end logic. Some of the benefits of the MVVM pattern include reusable components, independent development of GUI and business or back-end logic, flexibility to modify GUI without having to change business or back-end logic, ease of unit testing, and reduced maintenance overhead. The proposed framework along with the open-source code makes it possible to easily extend the application functionality thus enabling other researchers and practitioners to develop their own versions of hearing loss diagnosis applications. The proposed software was evaluated by an otolaryngologist and found to be very beneficial in assisting a clinician to reach a hearing impairment diagnosis conclusion more methodically, swiftly and accurately.","",""

It is commonly used in applications based on the technology Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).In applications where map components are used (software components that display maps to the user) it may be difficult to apply the MVVM design pattern, depending on how the map component is constructed.In this study, three map components are tested in order to evaluate if problems arise in the implementation of these map components in an application based on the technology WPF and the MVVM design pattern. In cases where problems arise, the necessary changes required to solve the problem are also described.The tested map components are TatukGIS, SharpMap and MapSUI. The results of the testing show that none of the map components have a built-in ability to create data bindings between the view and the viewmodel, which is required in order to comply with MVVM.

Although 3D representation of digital content has introduced digitalization in all digital image processing associated fields but finding the relevancy between 3D objects is still concerned area and extensive research must be done to achieve relevant relevancy between 3D objects. In literature, vast amount of algorithms are proposed based on model-based approach or view-based approach which results in inaccurate data for 3D representation of digital content. In this work, collaboration of both viewmodel relevance among 3D objects for retrieval and 3D objects perception is performed based on various graph structures. Object hypergraph structure (view information) is implemented at initial stage to perceive the 3D objects in multiple views and an object graph is constructed for model data for obtaining the information about the relationship between the different features of the obtained 3D objects. The proposed method registers good performance and reliability over traditional state of art methods and experiments are conducted on two data sets respectively.","",""

Oleh sebab itu, diperlukan adanya sistem manajemen waktu yang baik. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk merancang sistem manejemen waktu dengan salah satu teknik manajemen waktu terpopuler bernama Teknik Pomodoro. Teknik yang dicetuskan Francesco Cirillo ini telah terbukti efektif oleh berbagai studi baik untuk produktivitas maupun kesehatan. Dalam penelitian ini digunakan metodologi penelitian waterfall yang terdiri dari tahap analisis, desain rancangan sistem, implementasi, pengujian, dan pemeliharaan. Sementara itu, aplikasi ini dirancang dengan arsitektur Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), sebuah arsitektur yang dirancang untuk memisahkan logika bisnis dengan tampilkan aplikasi. Hasil penelitian ini adalah sebuah aplikasi manajemen waktu dengan Teknik Pomodoro berbasis MVVM yang berjalan di perangkat desktop. Melalui pengujian beta, Aplikasi ini telah diuji coba oleh sejumlah pengguna secara langsung.
