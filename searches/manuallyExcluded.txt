The sheer number of different products that can be derived from PL points out to the scale of the challenge that Product Line Engineering (PLE) faces. Various development artifacts describe PL but due to their diversity, variability modeling across PL is a challenging task. Moreover, this complexity is a major obstacle for achieving traceability across PL which is especially important for product verification. In order to support systems engineering by establishing traceability across PL and aid verification planning we propose Multi-View Variability Model (MVVM). MVVM introduces a set of variability models that represent variability in various development artifacts, e.g. architecture, requirements etc. and corresponding inter-model constraints. We provide a formalization of MVVM and perform a transformation of the MVVM model to a Constraint Satisfiability Problem (CSP) where we formulate queries for the CSP model in order to extract information about variability dependencies among MVVM views. Throughout the paper we use a real system from the automotive domain as the working example in order to illustrate the introduced concepts.","",""

DUPLICATE 2,"Waseem Sheikh, Nadeem Sheikh","A Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Application Framework for Hearing Impairment Diagnosis - Type Dependency Architecture",2019,"","","","",25,"2023-02-26 08:28:03","","10.1109/IETC47856.2020.9249181","","",,,,,2,0.50,1,2,4,"Around 466 million people worldwide (over 5% of the world's population) have disabling hearing loss, and out of these 34 million are children. Estimates suggest that by 2050, over 900 million people worldwide will have disabling hearing loss. The annual global cost of unaddressed hearing loss amounts to US$ 750 billion. Early detection of hearing loss can reduce its impact on an individual's life in addition to saving a huge cost. This paper, the second in a series of three papers, presents the type dependency architecture of an open-source application framework for hearing impairment diagnosis. The framework is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern which separates the development of graphical user interface (GUI) from the development of business and back-end logic. Some of the benefits of the MVVM pattern include reusable components, independent development of GUI and business or back-end logic, flexibility to modify GUI without having to change business or back-end logic, ease of unit testing, and reduced maintenance overhead. The proposed framework along with the open-source code makes it possible to easily extend the application functionality thus enabling other researchers and practitioners to develop their own versions of hearing loss diagnosis applications. The proposed software was evaluated by an otolaryngologist and found to be very beneficial in assisting a clinician to reach a hearing impairment diagnosis conclusion more methodically, swiftly and accurately.","",""

MVVM separates the graphical interface and business processes, making it easier to develop and maintain applications. In an MVVM implementation, event and observer data are separated, observing calls from event listeners are avoided, and state is used for data. The MVVM architectural pattern can also reduce dependencies so that there is no close relationship between the view and the viewmodel. In addition, MVVM can also be used to manage the concentration of Android application development that functions as a public complaint. In this community complaint application it is intended that the public can notify their complaints without having to come to the location of the complaint. In addition, it can make it easier for the authorities to follow up on these complaints, so that the public government can provide better service and be responsive to complaints from the public.","",""

Estimates suggest that by 2050, over 900 million people worldwide will have disabling hearing loss. The annual global cost of unaddressed hearing loss amounts to US$ 750 billion. Early detection of hearing loss can reduce its impact on an individual's life in addition to saving a huge cost. This paper, the first in a series of three papers, presents the design and features of an open-source application framework for hearing impairment diagnosis. The framework is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern which separates the development of graphical user interface (GUI) from the development of business and back-end logic. Some of the benefits of the MVVM pattern include reusable components, independent development of GUI and business or back-end logic, flexibility to modify GUI without having to change business or back-end logic, ease of unit testing, and reduced maintenance overhead. The proposed framework along with the open-source code makes it possible to easily extend the application functionality thus enabling other researchers and practitioners to develop their own versions of hearing loss diagnosis applications. The proposed software was evaluated by an otolaryngologist and found to be very beneficial in assisting a clinician to reach a hearing impairment diagnosis conclusion more methodically, swiftly and accurately.","",""

It is commonly used in applications based on the technology Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).In applications where map components are used (software components that display maps to the user) it may be difficult to apply the MVVM design pattern, depending on how the map component is constructed.In this study, three map components are tested in order to evaluate if problems arise in the implementation of these map components in an application based on the technology WPF and the MVVM design pattern. In cases where problems arise, the necessary changes required to solve the problem are also described.The tested map components are TatukGIS, SharpMap and MapSUI. The results of the testing show that none of the map components have a built-in ability to create data bindings between the view and the viewmodel, which is required in order to comply with MVVM.

Although 3D representation of digital content has introduced digitalization in all digital image processing associated fields but finding the relevancy between 3D objects is still concerned area and extensive research must be done to achieve relevant relevancy between 3D objects. In literature, vast amount of algorithms are proposed based on model-based approach or view-based approach which results in inaccurate data for 3D representation of digital content. In this work, collaboration of both viewmodel relevance among 3D objects for retrieval and 3D objects perception is performed based on various graph structures. Object hypergraph structure (view information) is implemented at initial stage to perceive the 3D objects in multiple views and an object graph is constructed for model data for obtaining the information about the relationship between the different features of the obtained 3D objects. The proposed method registers good performance and reliability over traditional state of art methods and experiments are conducted on two data sets respectively.","",""

Since the last update in 2015, the complex genomes of numerous Brassicaceae species have been decoded, accompanied by many omics datasets. To provide an up-to-date service, we report here a major upgrade of the portal. The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) framework of BRAD has been re-engineered to enable easy and sustainable maintenance of the database. The collection of genomes has been increased to 26 species, along with optimization of the user interface. Features of the previous version have been retained, with additional new tools for exploring syntenic genes, gene expression and variation data. In the ‘Syntenic Gene @ Subgenome’ module, we added features to view the sequence alignment and phylogenetic relationships of syntenic genes. New modules include ‘MicroSynteny’ for viewing synteny of selected fragment pairs, and ‘Polymorph’ for retrieval of variation data. The updated BRAD provides a substantial expansion of genomic data and a comprehensive improvement of the service available to the Brassicaceae research community.","",""

In addition, the trend of miniaturization has allowed the development of new portable equipment, increasing the possibilities of point-of-use analysis at low cost. In this context, the objective of this study was to develop a portable analytical methodology using a low-cost DLP NIRscan Nano spectrophotometer (Texas Instruments®) connected to a smartphone for data storage. For this, an app called NanoMetrix was developed, created natively for Android from Android Studio IDE, according to a software design standard known as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM). To demonstrate the applicability of the method, 36 samples of plant tissue were analyzed to determine total nitrogen content.

METHODS ACE is developed with C# using Microsoft .Net framework and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for elegant GUI design and smooth GUI transition animations through the integration of graphics engines and high dots per inch (DPI) settings on modern high resolution monitors. The industrial standard software design pattern, Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, is chosen to be the major architecture of ACE for neat coding structure, deep modularization, easy maintainability and seamless communication with other clinical software. ACE consists of 1) a patient data importing module integrated with clinical patient database server, 2) a 2D DICOM image and RT structure simultaneously displaying module, 3) a 3D RT structure visualization module using Visualization Toolkit or VTK library and 4) a contour evaluation module using supervised pattern recognition algorithms to detect contouring errors and display detection results. ACE relies on supervised learning algorithms to handle all image processing and data processing jobs. Implementations of related algorithms are powered by Accord.Net scientific computing library for better efficiency and effectiveness.   RESULTS ACE can take patient's CT images and RT structures from commercial treatment planning software via direct user input or from patients' database. All functionalities including 2D and 3D image visualization and RT contours error detection have been demonstrated with real clinical patient cases.   CONCLUSION ACE implements supervised learning algorithms and combines image processing and graphical visualization modules for RT contours verification. ACE has great potential for automated radiotherapy contouring quality verification.

It can handle multiple streams at relatively high data rates with short latencies, making it suitable for advanced medical applications such as electrocardiograms (ECG). This framework also supports filtering, post processing, and saving the data in non-volatile storage. A novel feature of our design is that we adopt the Model View View-Model (MVVM) design pattern that reduces complexity and maximizes code reusability compared to the standard Model View Controller (MVC) pattern in iOS while remaining compatible. Experimental results using a real-world ECG, on-board sensors, and pre-recorded results over actual and simulated iOS devices confirm that SPK enables developers to build feature-rich, robust apps that embed real-time, responsive plotting capability while significantly shortening development time.

This could potentially save a lot of time and add value by enabling the ability to run several iterations of the transport route with little effort. The thesis presents a new workflow, based on using the new application, and discusses advantages and disadvantages between the new and current workflow for transport route verification. By using Autodesk Navisworks and its .NET and COM API, a plug-in application was created for Navisworks, to automatically verify movement of an object through a given access way. This was done using Navisworks clash detective feature through the .NET API. The plug-in application required input parameter such as a validation object, a boundary geometry and a path. The plug-in application is divided into two phases; one path optimizing phase, and one verification phase. The optimizing phase is a pre-phase for the verification phase, to optimize run-time speed. The verification phase uses dynamic relaxation to try to move the validation object through the given path. If the validation object clashes with the boundary geometry, the dynamic relaxation will try to find a point of equilibrium where there is no clash. The plug-in application uses WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) as a presentation system in .NET, with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The visualization of the validation object’s movement, and the verification result, is done via Navisworks .NET API, where the movement is presented in Navisworks’ own UI. The plug-in application’s UI will present information about the status of a verification. The UI gives the opportunity for the user to monitor the velocity, acceleration and applied force in the dynamic relaxation method during verification using chart controls.","",""

This dissertation provide an overview on the planning and implementation of a graphical modeling tool of document flows to serve an existing platform to manage them. The document flow can be described as a document oriented process in opposition to business processes, BPM, which are oriented to business work routines. The first analysis of the problem was to understand the components that in which all the flow logic is divided. There are a set of elements, that define the flow design. In that set of elements there is a particular one, the operation, that can be associated to services/plug-ins, responsible to provide a certain automatism. In the second analysis was concluded that the set of elements is quite simple. The core of this platform is the the logic flexibility provided by the services associated to the automatic operations. The main goal of this project was to find a way to balance between the simplicity of the flow architecture logic with the perspective of this logic suffers a evolution, taking into account the users profiles and the maintainability. Although the standards chosen, BPMN (Business Process Modeling) and XPDL (XML Process Definition Language), provide the necessary means so that the flow can be defined and at the same time save some elements to cover the emergence of new components in the flow design, it was also necessary to take into account the case of this notation became unuseful for this platform. As a consequence, this solution was implemented under an layer architecture named MVVM (Model View View-Model), which abstracts the user interface and data model. The goals of this work were completed successfully, since it was built a solution using standard formats that ensures the necessary basis to define a flow under the rules that this platform demands. The definition of the flow was divided into modules that separate the draw logic and services logic, facilitating the maintenance and definition of each one of these components.","",""

Specifically, the system consists of a remote data service platform, the data collection terminals build on Raspberry Pi and the wireless data transmission using narrow-band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) modules. The data service platform is designed with the separated front-end and rear-end. The front-end is a web page constructed by the Vue.js and Element, while the rear-end business logic processing is constructed using the Python Django framework. The data interaction between the front and rear ends is realized through Axios. In such a way, the data in the front-end and the rear-end are decoupled, which makes it possible to improve the capability in dealing with complex data and makes it easy to carry out add-on development and extend new functions. Based on the data service platform, a series of basic application functions are integrated, including real-time data monitoring, historical data query, data visualization and abnormal data alerting, etc. Moreover, we integrate a deep-learning-based plant disease and pest detection algorithm in the propose system to show its scalability.

Using real-time hydraulic and water quality measurements and run-time models, NetSafe is capable of identifying the presence of contaminants and predicting their sources and destinations in DWDS for vulnerability analysis and optimal emergency response. NetSafe uses a model-based anomaly detection approach that can be used with any type of sensor. The contaminant source identification leverages the Contaminant Status Algorithm (CSA), and the contaminant spread is determined using the EPANET MSX engine. NetSafe has been developed as .NET application written in C#. It is based on a robust design pattern called “Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)” that permits scalability as well as flexibility. The user interface can be completely defined using an XML like syntax called the eXtensible Application Markup Language (XAML). NetSafe has the ability to connect to relational databases to obtain SCADA data, and it has been tested with both Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and Microsoft Access 2003. The results displayed by NetSafe were independently verified using an Excel-based workbench. The architecture evolved through the creation of use case diagram, class diagram, communication diagram, sequence diagram, state activity diagram. These capabilities of NetSafe were tested using “Network 3” from the EPANET sample data and multispecies water quality kinetics, and the initial results appear to be promising.

Fur die Analyse wurden Gesprache, sowohl mit Fachleuten die im Brunnenbau und in der Brunnenwartung und –sanierung tatig sind, als auch mit Brunnenbetreibern gefuhrt, um in Erfahrung zu bringen, wie alltagliche Arbeitsablaufe gestaltet sind und welche Dokumente und Daten dabei beteiligt sind. Im Anschluss wurde ein Konzept fur die Erfassung der Stammdaten eines Brunnens, sowie fur die Betriebsdatenverarbeitung erstellt. Zur Umsetzung des Konzeptes in Form eines Prototypens eines Brunnenmanagementsystems wurde die Programmiersprache C# eingesetzt. Weiterhin kamen die Technologien Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Entity Framework, PRISM sowie das Entwurfsmuster Model View ViewModel (MVVM) zum Einsatz. Als Datengrundlage dienen Brunnnenbetriebsdaten und –unterlagen deutscher Wasserversorger, welche fur die Entwicklung des Prototypens zur Verfugung gestellt worden sind. Mit dem erstellten Brunnenmanagementsystem konnen die Stammdaten von Brunnen in Form einer digitalen Brunnenakte verwaltet werden. Diese digitale Brunnenakte beinhaltet ein Dokumentenmanagement fur eine geeignete Datenhaltung der digitalen Unterlagen. Neben diesen Dokumenten konnen Stammdaten wertemasig auf Eingabemasken detailliert erfasst werden. Weiterhin ist die Datenubernahme von Betriebsdaten aus Prozessleitsystemen und von Datenloggern, der in den Brunnen verbauten Sensoren, mit Hilfe eines Importmodules moglich. Fur diesen Import konnen auserdem Filter zur Reduzierung der Datenmengen konfiguriert werden, welche die Betriebsdaten bei der Ubernahme automatisch ausdunnen, ohne dabei wertvolle Informationen zu verlieren. Das System zeigt auserdem die Potentiale der IT-gestutzten Auswertung von Betriebsdaten. Zur Veranschaulichung wurde hierfur die Berechnung von spezifischen Brunnenergiebigkeiten, aus virtuellen Pumpversuchen – generiert durch die Betriebsdaten – implementiert.

Dieses Management soll es ermoglichen, unterschiedliche fachdomanenspezifische Analysen und Simulationen effizient zu kombinieren und bedarfsgerecht zu visualisieren. Dabei wird zunachst analysiert, welche Austauschformate von den unterschiedlichen Fachdomanen genutzt werden und wie sich deren Aufbau unterscheidet. Anschliesend wird ein Konzept erstellt, dessen Datenmodell die Daten aller zuvor analysierten Austauschformate verlustfrei reprasentieren kann. Zusatzlich umfasst das Konzept die Datenverwaltung sowie Moglichkeiten der Visualisierung und Analyse der Daten uber eine Benutzeroberflache. Hierbei wird im Besonderen auf die Bereiche Wasserbewirtschaftung sowie Gebaudekategorisierung eingegangen. Im Anschluss wird die Umsetzung des Konzepts in Form eines Prototypen beschrieben. Hierbei werden anhand zuvor festgelegter Kriterien verschiedene Datenbanksysteme analysiert, um eine geeignete Datenhaltung zu gewahrleisten. Zur Umsetzung des Systems wird die Programmiersprache C#, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) sowie das Entwurfsmuster Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) verwendet. Als Datengrundlage fur den Bereich Wasserbewirtschaftung dienen Flurabstandsplane sowie Gebaudedaten von OpenStreetMap.

This includes the ability to view historical results in an array of different graphs, which allows the user to quickly identify trends, such that patterns of problematic readings can be addressed. Equally, stable readings will help to reinforce the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, which should in turn encourage the user to continue with that approach.    To facilitate communication between the user and their doctor/healthcare professional (HCP) it allows results to be shared both via email with a csv attachment directly from the App, and also by means of the external sync option. The latter allows the user to sync all recorded results from the devices local database with an external website. The doctor can then log in to this website and see real time data and advise the patient on any changes needed.    An appointments section helps the user keep track of upcoming appointments and a notification of an upcoming appointment servers as a reminder to either send or upload your latest results.    For development Visual Studio is being used and languages used are C# and XAML. SQLite is being used for the database which is stored on the devices and Microsoft Azure will host the website.

Testing is done to make sure that the product meets the requirements of the customers who transform the paperboard to packaging products. In the Skoghall paperboard Mill operators make use of a range of different test methods. Since the work pace is high and the product is being continuously tested improvements of the workflow at the laboratory are always of interest. The aim of this project is to develop a program that connects test instruments at Skoghall Mill’s test laboratory to the Mill’s network. The motivation is to automate part of the work process by removing the step of manually reading measurement values from the test instruments. The scope of this project includes developing software that connects one of the instruments (the Short Span Compression tester [1] or SCT) at the laboratory to the Mill’s network. This program, named TestLink, will work as a proof of concept for connecting instruments using a common interface. The software is constructed using a modular approach forming a platform where an additional instrument can be connected by creating a new module. The software is developed in Visual Studio using C# as the programming language. The software architecture follows the MVVM [2] (Model View ViewModel) design pattern paradigm and WPF [3] (Windows Presentation Foundation) is used to construct the graphical user interface. The result shows that time savings can be made when automating part of the work with the introduction of new software.","",""

Das Co-Browsing ermoglicht es dem Kundenberater, entweder seine eigene Anzeige dem Kunden freizugeben, oder die Anzeige seines Kunden zu ubernehmen. Dabei wird nicht wie bei herkommlichen Fernwartungs-Losungen der Zugriff auf das gesamte System gewahrt, sondern nur auf die aktuelle Anzeige innerhalb des Webbrowsers. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurde vorerst eine Evaluation bestehender Co-Browsing Losungen durchgefuhrt, welche ergab, dass der Stand der heutigen Technologien fur einen Einsatz in einer produktiven E-Banking Umgebung noch nicht genugend ausgereift ist. Aus diesem Grund wurde die Losung als Prototyp in einer simulierten E-Banking Plattform implementiert. Zwischen den Browsern (Kunde/Berater) wird eine Verbindung uber WebSockets hergestellt und mittels Nachrichten Informationen ubertragen. Um auf Anderungen der Anzeige (z.B. Seitenwechsel) zu reagieren, wird das Document Object Model (DOM) uberwacht und bei Mutationen werden Events ausgelost, um die Gegenstelle abzugleichen. Die Serverseite (WebSockets) wurde in JavaScript (Node.js) implementiert. Der Server stellt zum einen die Kommunikation zwischen Kunde und Berater uber Channels sicher und beinhaltet zum anderen eine Datenstruktur fur das Persistieren der Informationen. Um auf der Clientseite eine grossere Web-Applikation simulieren zu konnen (z.B. clientseitiges Routing, Login) wurde das JavaScript Framework AngularJS verwendet.

Hinter Xamarin steht das Mono Framework, eine Open Source Implementierung des Microsofts .NET Framework, welches im Jahr 2001 erstmals veroffentlicht wurde. Der Vorteil von Xamarin ist, dass native Applikationen fur alle drei fuhrenden mobilen Plattformen mit der gleichen Programmiersprache C# entwickelt werden konnen. Xamarin hat die Schnittstelle von Android und iOS mit regularen C# Klassen gekapselt. Entwickler profitieren von der modernen Programmiersprache C# und deren Funktionalitaten wie LINQ, funktionalen Lambda Ausdrucken und Generics. Im Gegensatz zu Web Apps wird das User Interface pro Plattform separat programmiert. Dadurch wird das gewunschte Benutzererlebnis erreicht und es konnen auch leistungskritische Anwendungen wie Spiele programmiert werden. Als primares Ziel gilt das gemeinsame Nutzen von Code. Mit Hilfe von portablen Klassenbibliotheken ist es moglich, den gleichen Code fur alle drei Plattformen zu nutzen. Eine saubere Trennung zwischen dem User Interface und dem Business Layer ist erstrebenswert. Um dies zu erreichen, muss das Model-View-ViewModel Muster (MVVM) plattformubergreifend genutzt werden konnen. Das Framework MvvmCross stellt hierfur einige Bibliotheken zur Verfugung. Nachdem die Grundlagen von Xamarin und MvvmCross bekannt waren, stand die Portierung der bestehenden Windows Phone App „MeteoCheck.ch“ auf Android und iOS im Vordergrund. Die Applikation bietet nebst den aktuellen Wetterprognosen auch zusatzlich Informationen wie zum Beispiel Lawineninformationen, Sonnenstand und Live Kamera Bilder. Nach einer grundlichen Analyse wurde das vorhandene Projekt in eine portable Klassenbibliothek und in ein Windows Phone Projekt aufgeteilt. Die portable Klassenbibliothek enthalt alle ViewModels und ist fur die Kommunikation mit dem Web Server zustandig. MvvmCross hat zudem einen IoC Container und ein Navigation Controller implementiert, wodurch die Navigation der einzelnen Ansichten uber die ViewModels gesteuert werden kann. Die grosste Schwierigkeit bestand fortan bei der Entwicklung der einzelnen User Interfaces. Bei der Android Entwicklung war dies vergleichsweise einfach, da Java Implementierungen fast identisch mit C# abgebildet werden konnten. Bei iOS Applikationen mit der nativen Programmiersprache Objectiv-C, war dies durch den gesetzten zeitlichen Rahmen schwieriger, was fur den weiteren Verlauf bedeutete, dass der Android Prototyp erweitert wurde. Abschliessend kann gesagt werden, dass mit Xamarin gute Applikationen entwickelt werden konnen, sofern die notwendigen Kenntnisse uber die Architektur und den Lebenszyklus der jeweiligen Plattformen vorhanden sind.","",""

In this article, a full-view urban waterlogging scenario is first defined and described from four dimensions. Next a structured representation of scenario element is given based on knowledge unit method. The full-view scenario model is then constructed by extracting the scenario correlation structures between different dimensions (called scenario nesting), i.e., inheritance nesting, feedback nesting, aggregation nesting, and selection nesting. Finally, a real-world case study in Wuhan East Lake High-tech Development Zone, China is evaluated to verify the reasonability of the full-viewmodel. The results show that the proposed model effectively integrates scenario data from different dimensions, which helps generate the complete key scenario information for urban waterlogging decision-making.

Therefore, we recommend the use of focused sharp portrait photographs either in the proper natural lighting or the use of flash. The photographs can be obtained by using either a smartphone or a digital camera. To avoid the distortion of the face, we also recommend taking the photographs from at least a half meter distance from the subject. This method uses the concept of detecting specific facial landmarks rather than detecting the whole face or trying to recognize the individual. This allows for the proper placement of the anatomical structures over the image. There are several limitations of this method. The face of some individuals may be disproportionate, which might alter the placement of the masks. In addition, the position and course of vessels and nerves of the face of different individual vary. Therefore, the results of this method should currently be used in the educational setting rather than a clinical one. However, the method could be improvised by collecting the information about the different variations of the course of vessels and nerves to construct “bands” of their course rather than definite lines. These bands could then be overlaid on the images to guide the clinician regarding the possible courses of the specific structure. Additional improvement of this method could include improving the accuracy of the ML model using a larger data set and using individual masks for the different vessels and nerves. Similarly, a lateral viewmodel could also be developed. Another use case scenario could be the overlaying of the facial muscles and underlying bones on the image. Being able to overlay these structures on an actual patient’s/subject’s photograph could make educational sessions of the use of botulinum toxins and facial fillers more interactive.","",""

Our objective is to provide an efficient and scalable cloud-based solution with facial recognition which can detect fake attendance and provide alerts to the management in case of irregular attendance. Our solution follows a verification process to avoid fake attendance. Initially, students have to upload a photo with their ID cards into our application. Next, the teacher or supervisor of the class will take a group photo of all the students and upload them into cloud through a mobile application, which will act as a user interface of our solution. The cloud architecture deployed in our solution combines various services like Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Simple Storage Service, Amazon Relational Database Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Amazon Lambda, Amazon Textract and Amazon Amplify in the most efficient manner in terms of storage and cost by regular deletion of unwanted data. We can then use the required cloud services to compare the faces of the student’s photo saved in our database with the group photo uploaded by the teacher to detect the students who are present. The proposed solution also analyzes the historical data within the database to prepare an aggregated report that consists of various fields like frequency of irregularity in attending classes, subject balance score and average attendance. While the back-end of the application is deployed in cloud, the front-end will be handled using Android as 70% of the general populace are dependent on this platform.

This surge in resource depletion and environmental pollution exerts an adverse influence on the well-being of individuals, while impeding societal progress and hindering the enhancement of overall quality of life. Within the domain of urban environmental design, the integration of visual displays emerges as a superior approach to facilitate the assimilation and analysis of green and low-carbon information. However, urban environmental data usually contains multiple dimensions, so it is a problem to realize the data representation of multiple dimensions while maintaining the correlation and interactivity between data. To surmount the challenge of visualizing such intricate information, this investigation initially employs a sophisticated memory-based clustering algorithm for information extraction, accompanied by a global similarity algorithm that meticulously computes attribute component quantities within specific dimensions of the vector. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent power of Vue’s bidirectional data binding capabilities, the study adopts the esteemed MVVM (Model-View-View-Model) pattern, fostering seamless two-way interaction through the established logical relationship. As a result, the amalgamation of multidimensional visualization technology empowers comprehensive data mining through a captivating visual augmentation. Concurrently, the application of data visualization dimension control delivers tailored displays tailored to green and low-carbon scenarios within urban environmental design. Experimental results impeccably validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, substantiated by a mere 1.77% false alarm rate for data stream difference detection and a clustering difference of 1.34%. The aforementioned algorithm accentuates the efficacy of visual displays, thus engendering a profound synergy between the industrial and supply chains. Moreover, it facilitates the design, production, and utilization of environmentally friendly products and energy sources. This, in turn, serves as a catalyst, propelling the widescale adoption of green and low-carbon practices throughout the entire industrial chain, fueled by the seamless integration of multimedia data.","",""

Zusammen mit der W&W Immo Informatik AG soll eine Losung entwickelt werden, welche es Verwaltern ermoglicht, die Abnahme von Wohnungen und Hausern mit Hilfe eines Tablets durchzufuhren.  Das Ziel ist, dass der Verwalter vor Ort von der Zusammenstellung der Wohnung, uber das Vermerken von Kommentaren bis zur Unterschrift, dem Erstellen eines Dokuments und dem Versand per Mail alles am selben Gerat und ohne Papier erledigen kann.  1.2 VORGEHEN/TECHNOLOGIEN  Fur die Entwicklung wurde C# verwendet und das User-Interface mit XAML umgesetzt. Um eine hohe Flexibilitat zu gewahrleisten, wurde das UI unter Anwendung des MVVM-Patterns strikt vom Code getrennt.  Die App wurde zudem in zwei Bereiche aufgeteilt:  - Handover: Die App mit den spezifischen Funktionen zur Wohnungsabnahme, der Navigation & UI. Diese basiert auf dem unten erwahnten Framework.  - Framework: Beinhaltet allgemeine Funktionen wie den FTP-Client sowie Komponenten zur PDF Generierung, Validierung, Datenverarbeitung und Persistierung. Diese konnen vom Auftraggeber in anderen Projekten wiederverwendet werden.  Wahrend der Entwicklung wurde der Test-Driven Development Ansatz verfolgt und dadurch eine hohe Testabdeckung erreicht.  1.3 ERGEBNIS  Am Ende entstand eine solide App, die von einem Kunden bereits erfolgreich bei einer Wohnungsabnahme getestet werden konnte. Das erhaltene Feedback hat gezeigt, dass eine Nachfrage fur die App vorhanden ist. Zudem stehen weitere Ideen im Raum, welche die App noch umfassender und flexibler machen um kundenspezifische Anforderungen besser abzudecken. Durch die hohe Testabdeckung wird die einwandfreie Funktionalitat gewahrleistet und bietet dem W&W Immo Informatik AG eine gute Kontrollmoglichkeit bei Anpassungen der App","",""

The application can be used on multiple devices thanks to synchronisation with a remote database. The theoretical part is focused on the principles of Android application development, modern technologies such as RxJava and Kotlin, and architectural pattern Model-View-ViewModel. The practical section then describes the complete application and offers an in-depth description of the application screens.","",""

Za izradu aplikacija koristen je niz tehnologija, razvojnih okvira i alata uz koje je pojasnjena njihova uporaba i generalna funkcija. Za razvoj korisnickog sucelja koristen je Javascript Vue.js razvojni okvir te Model-View-ViewModel paradigma, dok je u administratorskom sucelju i serverskoj logici aplikacije koristen PHP i Laravel razvojni okvir, te ucestala Model-View-Controller paradigma. Osim osnovne logike iza aplikacije obrađen je i kratak povijesni pregled spomenutih tehnologija, a i niz dodatnih cesto koristenih alata u danasnjem standardnom razvojnom okruženju.","",""
