# Step 3: Attribute Classification Design

In this step, we design the classification of the attributes of the literature.
We use the language workbench JetBrains MPS to define a language to structure the scheme.

See https://github.com/anonymized/mps-literature-review language definition.

## Outcome

The MPS DSL `mps-literature-review`.
It defines concepts like `WebsiteSource`, `ScholarSource`, `DesignCriteria`, `BenefitCriteria`, and `ContraCriteria`.
We also prepared a model-to-text generator which generates the main results into markdown later.

## Next Step

See `step4_data_extraction/README.md`
